( 2 ) trends in recent repurchases and make-wholes ; ( 3 ) historical percentage of claims made as a percentage of loan documentation package requests ; ( 4 ) success rate in appealing claims ; ( 5 ) inventory of unresolved claims ; and ( 6 ) estimated loss given repurchase or make-whole , including the loss of principal , accrued interest , and foreclosure costs . the company does not change its estimation methodology by counterparty , but the historical experience and trends are considered when evaluating the overall reserve . the request for loan documentation packages is an early indicator of a potential claim . during 2009 , loan documentation package requests and the level of outstanding claims increased . in addition , our loss severity estimates increased during 2009 due to the impact of macroeconomic factors and recent experience . these factors contributed to a $ 493 million change in estimate for this reserve in 2009 . as indicated above , the repurchase reserve is calculated by sales vintage . the majority of the repurchases in 2009 were from the 2006 and 2007 sales vintages , which also represent the vintages with the largest loss- given-repurchase . an insignificant percentage of 2009 repurchases were from vintages prior to 2006 , and this is expected to decrease , because those vintages are later in the credit cycle . although early in the credit cycle , the company has experienced improved repurchase and loss-given-repurchase statistics from the 2008 and 2009 vintages . in the case of a repurchase of a credit-impaired sop 03-3 loan ( now incorporated into asc 310-30 ) , the difference between the loan 2019s fair value and unpaid principal balance at the time of the repurchase is recorded as a utilization of the repurchase reserve . payments to make the investor whole are also treated as utilizations and charged directly against the reserve . the provision for estimated probable losses arising from loan sales is recorded as an adjustment to the gain on sale , which is included in other revenue in the consolidated statement of income . a liability for representations and warranties is estimated when the company sells loans and is updated quarterly . any subsequent adjustment to the provision is recorded in other revenue in the consolidated statement of income . the activity in the repurchase reserve for the years ended december 31 , 2009 and 2008 is as follows: .\n\ngoodwill goodwill represents an acquired company 2019s acquisition cost over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired . goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests , whereby goodwill is allocated to the company 2019s reporting units and an impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value . furthermore , on any business dispositions , goodwill is allocated to the business disposed of based on the ratio of the fair value of the business disposed of to the fair value of the reporting unit . intangible assets intangible assets 2014including core deposit intangibles , present value of future profits , purchased credit card relationships , other customer relationships , and other intangible assets , but excluding msrs 2014are amortized over their estimated useful lives . intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives , primarily certain asset management contracts and trade names , are not amortized and are subject to annual impairment tests . an impairment exists if the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value . for other intangible assets subject to amortization , an impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset . other assets and other liabilities other assets include , among other items , loans held-for-sale , deferred tax assets , equity-method investments , interest and fees receivable , premises and equipment , end-user derivatives in a net receivable position , repossessed assets , and other receivables. .\n\nTable:\nin millions of dollars\t2009\t2008\nbalance beginning of the year\t$ 75\t$ 2\nadditions for new sales\t33\t23\nchange in estimate\t493\t59\nutilizations\t-119 ( 119 )\t-9 ( 9 )\nbalance end of the year\t$ 482\t$ 75",

Prior year additions primarily relate to stock-based compensation. Prior year reductions are primarily composed of federal and state reserves related to transfer pricing and research credits and resulted from the completion of the 2015 U.S. federal audit in the first quarter of 2019. Of the $21.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2019, $12.7 million would impact the consolidated income tax rate if ultimately recognized. The remaining $8.5 million would impact deferred taxes if recognized. Teradyne does not anticipate a material change in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2019 in the next twelve months. Teradyne records all interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax items at December 31, 2019 and 2018 amounted to $1.4 million and $0.3 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, expense of $1.1 million, expense of $0.1 million and benefit of $0.1 million, respectively, was recorded for interest and penalties related to income tax items.

Order growth was strongest in the solutions and services business on a sharply higher volume from large orders in the Americas and Europe, C. I. S., Africa, Middle East. Revenue rose most strongly in the systems and software and the solutions and services businesses, particularly in the Americas. Revenue growth in the product business was due to low voltage products, while revenue in the other products businesses came in close to prior-year levels due partly to less favorable conditions in short-cycle markets. Adjusted EBITA declined due mainly to the systems and software business including negative effects related to grid control projects early in the year. Adjusted EBITA also included higher expenses year-over-year related to expansion of smart building offerings and for grid edge activities. Severance charges were \u20ac 48 million in fiscal 2019 compared to \u20ac 34 million a year earlier. Smart Infrastructure\u2019s order backlog was \u20ac 10 billion at the end of the fiscal year, of which \u20ac 7 billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal 2020. Smart Infrastructure achieved its results in overall moderately growing markets in fiscal 2019. The grid markets benefited from the need for intelligent and flexible energy networks and for automation, particularly in Asia, Australia and the Americas. Heavy industries and the infrastructure industry also developed favorably during fiscal 2019, driven by investments in oil and gas markets, in data centers and in transportation infrastructure, such as for e-mobility. Discrete industries, which started strong\nin fiscal 2019, experienced a downturn in the second half of the fiscal year. Construction markets continued their stable growth during the fiscal year, particularly in the U. S. and China and in the non-residential construction market overall. Growth in the important building electrification and automation market was driven by demand for building performance and sustainability offerings, including strong demand for energy efficiency and digital services. In fiscal 2020, market growth overall is expected to\nbe lower than in fiscal 2019, due to an expected continuation of the downturn in the short-cycle markets, economic uncertainty in a number of countries due to trade conflicts, and other factors. Beginning with fiscal 2020, the distribution transformer business will be transferred to the Operating Company Gas and Power. If this organizational structure had already existed in fiscal 2019, Smart Infrastructure would have posted orders of \u20ac 15.590 billion, revenue of \u20ac 14.597 billion, Adjusted EBITA of \u20ac 1.465 billion and an Adjusted EBITA margin of 10.0 %.\nTable:\n\t\tFiscal year\t\t% Change\n(in millions of \u20ac)\t2019\t2018\tActual\tComp.\nOrders\t16,244\t15,198\t7%\t4%\nRevenue\t15,225\t14,445\t5%\t3%\ntherein: product business\t5,530\t5,302\t4%\t2%\nAdjusted EBITA\t1,500\t1,574\t(5)%\t\nAdjusted EBITA margin\t9.9 %\t10.9 %\t\t",
