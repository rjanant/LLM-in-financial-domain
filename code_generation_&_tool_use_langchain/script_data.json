Under IAS 39, we classified investments as available-for-sale, loans and receivables, and fair value through profit or loss. On transition to IFRS 9 we have reclassified them as fair value through other comprehensive income, fair value through profit or loss, and amortised cost, as set out in note 1. The current year figures in the following table reflect the classifications under IFRS 9, and the prior year figures reflect the previous classifications under IAS 39. Investments held at amortised cost consist of investments previously classified as loans and receivables and relate to money market investments denominated in sterling of \u00a32,687m (2017/18: \u00a3416m, 2016/17: \u00a335m), in US dollars of \u00a326m (2017/18: \u00a327m, 2016/17: \u00a330m) in euros of \u00a3499m (2017/18: \u00a3nil, 2016/17: \u00a3nil) and in other currencies \u00a32m (2017/18: \u00a34m, 2016/17: \u00a318m).

Total revenue in fiscal 2019 increased by 5% compared with fiscal 2018. Product revenue increased by 6% and service revenue increased by 2%. Our total revenue reflected growth across each of our geographic segments. Product revenue for the BRICM countries, in the aggregate, experienced 1% product revenue decline, driven by a 16% decrease in product revenue in China and a decrease of 1% in Brazil. These decreases were partially offset by increased product revenue in Mexico, Russia and India of 26%, 6% and 5%, respectively. In addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors, including a reduced IT spending environment and reductions in spending by government entities, revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition, including the complexity of transactions such as multiple performance obligations; the mix of financing arrangements provided to channel partners and customers; and final acceptance of the product, system, or solution, among other factors. In addition, certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition, which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment.\nTable:\n\t\tYears Ended\t\t2019 vs. 2018\t\n\tJuly 27, 2019\tJuly 28, 2018\tJuly 29, 2017\tVariance in Dollars\tVariance in Percent\nRevenue:\t\t\t\t\t\nAmericas\t$ 30,927\t$ 29,070\t$28,351\t$1,857\t6%\nPercentage of revenue\t59.6%\t58.9%\t59.1%\t\t\nEMEA\t13,100\t12,425\t12,004\t675\t5%\nPercentage of revenue\t25.2%\t25.2%\t25.0%\t\t\nAPJC\t7,877\t7,834\t7,650\t43\t1%\nPercentage of revenue\t15.2%\t15.9%\t15.9%\t\t\nTotal\t$51,904\t$49,330\t$48,005\t$2,574\t5%",

Net Sales MSA net sales of $240.7 million in fiscal year 2019 increased $13.8 million or 6.1% from $227.0 million in fiscal year 2018. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by a $15.0 million increase in OEM sales in the JPKO region. Also contributing to the increase in net sales was a $4.3 million increase in EMS sales across all regions and a $3.7 million increase in distributor sales across the Americas and EMEA regions. These increase in net sales were partially offset by a $5.5 million decrease in distributor sales across the APAC and JPKO regions and a $3.8 million decrease in OEM sales across the Americas, APAC, and JPKO regions. Reportable Segment Operating Income Segment operating income of $22.5 million in fiscal year 2019 increased $6.9 million from $15.7 million in fiscal year 2018. The increase in operating income was primarily due to a $6.6 million decrease in SG&A expenses resulting from a decrease in payroll expenses that was caused by a reduction in head count. Also contributing to the increase in operating income was a $2.9 million decrease in restructuring charges, a $1.3 million decrease in net loss on write down and disposal of long-lived assets, and a $0.2 million decrease in R&D expenses.

components essential to the company's business are generally available from multiple sources , other key components ( including microprocessors and application-specific integrated circuits , or ( \"asics\" ) ) are currently obtained by the company from single or limited sources . some other key components , while currently available to the company from multiple sources , are at times subject to industry- wide availability and pricing pressures . in addition , the company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry , and new products introduced by the company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the company has evaluated whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers . if the supply of a key single-sourced component to the company were to be delayed or curtailed or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays shipments of completed products to the company , the company's ability to ship related products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely affected . the company's business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source , or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source . continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company's requirements . finally , significant portions of the company's cpus , logic boards , and assembled products are now manufactured by outsourcing partners , the majority of which occurs in various parts of asia . although the company works closely

between july 19 , 2000 , and september 28 , 2000 . the complaints allege violations of the 1934 securities exchange act and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief . the company believes these claims are without merit and intends to defend them vigorously . the company filed a motion to dismiss on june 4 , 2002 , which was heard by the court on september 13 , 2002 . on december 11 , 2002 , the court granted the company's motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action , with leave to plaintiffs to amend their complaint within thirty days . the company is subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully adjudicated . in the opinion of management , the company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition , liquidity or results of operations . however , the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty . should the company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the

product may be substantial . however , because it is likely that specific laws , regulations , and enforcement policies will vary significantly between individual european member states , it is not currently possible to estimate the company's existing liability or future expenses resulting from the directive . as the european union and its individual member states clarify specific requirements

india , nigeria and uganda , wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the united states , and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in underdeveloped areas . a majority of consumers in these markets still utilize basic wireless services , predominantly on feature phones , while advanced device penetration remains low . in more developed urban locations within these markets , early-stage data network deployments are underway . carriers are focused on completing voice network build-outs while also investing in initial data networks as wireless data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate . in markets with rapidly evolving network technology , such as south africa and most of the countries in latin america where we do business , initial voice networks , for the most part , have already been built out , and carriers are focused on 3g network build outs , with select investments in 4g technology . consumers in these regions are increasingly adopting smartphones and other advanced devices , and as a result , the usage of bandwidth-intensive mobile applications is growing materially . recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks . smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are growing rapidly , which typically requires that carriers continue to invest in their networks in order to maintain and augment their quality of service . finally , in markets with more mature network technology , such as germany , carriers are focused on deploying 4g data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage amongst their customer base . with higher smartphone and advanced device penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage , carrier investment in networks is focused on 4g coverage and capacity . we believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the united states , which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements

        "context": "table of contents recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and begins with a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test prescribed by gaap . for those reporting units where it is required , the first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value . if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount , goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary . to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value , a second step is performed , wherein the reporting unit's carrying value of goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of goodwill . to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value , impairment exists and must be recognized . the calculation of estimated fair value is based on two valuation techniques , a discounted cash flow model ( income approach ) and a market adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues ( market approach ) , with each method being weighted in the calculation . the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination . the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit ( including any unrecognized intangible assets ) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit , as determined in the first step of the goodwill impairment test , was the price paid to acquire that reporting unit . recoverability of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives ( i.e . trademarks ) is determined on a relief from royalty methodology ( income approach ) , which is based on the implied royalty paid , at an appropriate discount rate , to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset . the present value of the after-tax cost savings ( i.e . royalty relief ) indicates the estimated fair value of the asset . any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess . intangible assets such as patents , customer-related intangible assets and other intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives . the weighted-average useful lives approximate the following: .\n\nrecoverability of intangible assets with finite useful lives is assessed in the same manner as property , plant and equipment as described above . income taxes : for purposes of the company 2019s consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the spin-off , income tax expense has been recorded as if the company filed tax returns on a stand-alone basis separate from ingersoll rand . this separate return methodology applies the accounting guidance for income taxes to the stand-alone financial statements as if the company was a stand-alone enterprise for the periods prior to the spin-off . therefore , cash tax payments and items of current and deferred taxes may not be reflective of the company 2019s actual tax balances prior to or subsequent to the spin-off . cash paid for income taxes for the year ended december 31 , 2015 was $ 80.6 million . the income tax accounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 , 2015 and 2014 include income taxes payable and deferred taxes allocated to the company at the time of the spin-off . the calculation of the company 2019s income taxes involves considerable judgment and the use of both estimates and allocations . deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities , applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse . the company recognizes future tax benefits , such as net operating losses and tax credits , to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered in its judgment to be more likely than not . the company regularly reviews the recoverability of its deferred tax assets considering its historic profitability , projected future taxable income , timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the feasibility of its tax planning strategies . where appropriate , the company records a valuation allowance with respect to a future tax benefit . product warranties : standard
