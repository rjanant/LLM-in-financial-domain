    "context": "The following table summarizes our consolidated cash and cash equivalents provided by (used for) operating, financing and investing activities for the periods presented: Operating Cash Flows Our consolidated net cash flow from operating activities fluctuates primarily as a result of changes in vessel utilization and TCE rates, changes in interest rates, fluctuations in working capital balances, the timing and amount of dry-docking expenditures, repairs and maintenance activities, vessel additions and dispositions, and foreign currency rates. Our exposure to the spot tanker market has contributed significantly to fluctuations in operating cash flows historically as a result of highly cyclical spot tanker rates. In addition, the production performance of certain of our FPSO units that operate under contracts with a production-based compensation component has contributed to fluctuations in operating cash flows. As the charter contracts of some of our FPSO units include incentives based on average annual oil prices, the changes in global oil prices during recent years have also impacted our operating cash flows. Consolidated net cash flow from operating activities increased to $383.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $182.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to a $127.2 million increase in income from operations mainly from operations (before depreciation, amortization, asset impairments, loss on sale of vessels and the amortization of in-process revenue contracts) of our businesses. For further discussion of changes in income from vessel operations from our businesses, please read “Item 5 – Operating and Financial Review and Prospects: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Recent Developments and Results of Operations.” In addition, there was a $9.9 million increase in cash flows from changes to non-cash working capital, a $23.6 million increase in dividends received from joint ventures, and a $17.1 million increase in direct financing lease payments received, which are presented as an operating cash inflow instead of an investing cash inflow after the adoption of ASU 2016-02 in 2019. Furthermore, interest expense, including realized losses on interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps, decreased a net amount of $38.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to a decrease in realized losses on cross currency swaps. These increases were partially offset by an increase in cash outflows of $15.9 million in dry-dock expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018. Financing Cash Flows The Daughter Entities hold all of our liquefied gas carriers (Teekay LNG) and all of our conventional tanker assets (Teekay Tankers). Teekay LNG received $317.8 million of net proceeds from the sale-leaseback financing transactions for the Yamal Spirit and Torben Spirit for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $370.1 million from the sale-leaseback financing transactions completed for the Magdala, Myrina and Megara for the same period in 2018. Teekay Tankers received $63.7 million from the sale-leaseback financing transactions completed on two of its Suezmax tankers for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $241.3 million in the same period last year from the sale-leaseback financing transactions completed on eight Aframax tankers, one Suezmax tanker and one LR2 Product tanker. We use our credit facilities to partially finance capital expenditures. Occasionally, we will use revolving credit facilities to finance these expenditures until longer-term financing is obtained, at which time we typically use all or a portion of the proceeds from the longer-term financings to prepay outstanding amounts under the revolving credit facilities. We actively manage the maturity profile of our outstanding financing arrangements. During 2019, we had a net cash outflow of $227.3 million relating primarily to prepayments of short-term and long-term debt, issuance costs and payments on maturity of cross currency swaps, net of proceeds from the issuances of short-term and long-term debt, compared to net cash inflow of $553.7 million in 2018. Scheduled repayments decreased by $438.1 million in 2019 compared to 2018. Historically, the Daughter Entities have distributed operating cash flows to their owners in the form of distributions or dividends. There were no equity financing transactions from the Daughter Entities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Teekay LNG repurchased $25.7 million of common units in the year ended December 31, 2019. Teekay Parent did not raise capital through equity financing transactions in December 31, 2019, compared to $103.7 million raised in 2018 from issuances of new equity to the public, thirdparty investors and two entities established by our founder (including Resolute, our largest shareholder). Cash dividends paid decreased by $16.6 million in 2019, as a result of the elimination of Teekay Parent's quarterly dividend on Teekay’s common stock commencing with the quarter ended March 31, 2019. Investing Cash Flows During 2019, we received $100 million from Brookfield for the sale of our remaining interests in Altera (please read \"Item 18 – Financial Statements: Note 4 – Deconsolidation and Sale of Altera\"). We incurred capital expenditures for vessels and equipment of $109.5 million primarily for capitalized vessel modifications and shipyard construction installment payments in Teekay LNG. Teekay LNG received proceeds of $11.5 million from the sale of the Alexander Spirit and contributed $72.4 million to its equity-accounted joint ventures and loans to joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily to fund project expenditures in the Yamal LNG Joint Venture and the Bahrain LNG Joint Venture. During 2019, Teekay Tankers received proceeds of $19.6 million related to the sale of one Suezmax tanker. During 2018, we incurred capital expenditures for vessels and equipment of $0.7 billion, primarily for capitalized vessel modifications and shipyard construction installment payments. Teekay Parent advanced $25.0 million to Altera in the form of a senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Teekay LNG received proceeds of $54.4 million from the sale of Teekay LNG's 50% ownership interest in the Excelsior Joint Venture and $28.5 million from the sales of the European Spirit and African Spirit. Teekay LNG contributed $40.5 million to its equityaccounted joint ventures and loans to joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily to fund project expenditures in the Yamal LNG Joint Venture, the Bahrain LNG project, and the Pan Union Joint Venture, and for working capital requirements for the MALT Joint Venture. Teekay incurred a net $25.3 million cash outflow as a result of the 2017 Brookfield Transaction (please read \"Item 18 – Financial Statements: Note 4 – Deconsolidation and Sale of Altera\").\nTable:\n(in thousands of U.S. Dollars)\tYear Ended December 31,\t\n\t2019\t2018\nNet operating cash flows\t383,306\t182,135\nNet financing cash flows\t(382,229)\t434,786\nNet investing cash flows\t(50,391)\t(663,456)",

Furthermore, interest expense, including realized losses on interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps, decreased a net amount of $38.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to a decrease in realized losses on cross currency swaps. These increases were partially offset by an increase in cash outflows of $15.9 million in dry-dock expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018. Financing Cash Flows The Daughter Entities hold all of our liquefied gas carriers (Teekay LNG) and all of our conventional tanker assets (Teekay Tankers). Teekay LNG received $317.8 million of net proceeds from the sale-leaseback financing transactions for the Yamal Spirit and Torben Spirit for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $370.1 million from the sale-leaseback financing transactions completed for the Magdala, Myrina and Megara for the same period in 2018. Teekay Tankers received $63.7 million from the sale-leaseback financing transactions completed on two of its Suezmax tankers for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $241.3 million in the same period last year from the sale-leaseback financing transactions completed on eight Aframax tankers, one Suezmax tanker and one LR2 Product tanker. We use our credit facilities to partially finance capital expenditures. Occasionally, we will use revolving credit facilities to finance these expenditures until longer-term financing is obtained, at which time we typically use all or a portion of the proceeds from the longer-term financings to prepay outstanding amounts under the revolving credit facilities. We actively manage the maturity profile of our outstanding financing arrangements. During 2019, we had a net cash outflow of $227.3 million relating primarily to prepayments of short-term and long-term debt, issuance costs and payments on maturity of cross currency swaps, net of proceeds from the issuances of short-term and long-term debt, compared to net cash inflow of $553.7 million in 2018. Scheduled repayments decreased by $438.1 million in 2019 compared to 2018. Historically, the Daughter Entities have distributed operating cash flows to their owners in the form of distributions or dividends. There were no equity financing transactions from the Daughter Entities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Teekay LNG repurchased $25.7 million of common units in the year ended December 31, 2019. Teekay Parent did not raise capital through equity financing transactions in December 31, 2019, compared to $103.7 million raised in 2018 from issuances of new equity to the public, thirdparty investors and two entities established by our founder (including Resolute, our largest shareholder). Cash dividends paid decreased by $16.6 million in 2019, as a result of the elimination of Teekay Parent's quarterly dividend on Teekay’s common stock commencing with the quarter ended March 31, 2019. Investing Cash Flows During 2019, we received $100 million from Brookfield for the sale of our remaining interests in Altera (please read \"Item 18 – Financial Statements: Note 4 – Deconsolidation and Sale of Altera\"). We incurred capital expenditures for vessels and equipment of $109.5 million primarily for capitalized vessel modifications and shipyard construction installment payments in Teekay LNG. Teekay LNG received proceeds of $11.5 million from the sale of the Alexander Spirit and contributed $72.4 million to its equity-accounted joint ventures and loans to joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily to fund project expenditures in the Yamal LNG Joint Venture and the Bahrain LNG Joint Venture. During 2019, Teekay Tankers received proceeds of $19.6 million related to the sale of one Suezmax tanker. During 2018, we incurred capital expenditures for vessels and equipment of $0.7 billion, primarily for capitalized vessel modifications and shipyard construction installment payments. Teekay Parent advanced $25.0 million to Altera in the form of a senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Teekay LNG received proceeds of $54.4 million from the sale of Teekay LNG's 50% ownership interest in the Excelsior Joint Venture and $28.5 million from the sales of the European Spirit and African Spirit. Teekay LNG contributed $40.5 million to its equityaccounted joint ventures and loans to joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily to fund project expenditures in the Yamal LNG Joint Venture, the Bahrain LNG project, and the Pan Union Joint Venture, and for working capital requirements for the MALT Joint Venture. Teekay incurred a net $25.3 million cash outflow as a result of the 2017 Brookfield Transaction (please read \"Item 18 – Financial Statements: Note 4 – Deconsolidation and Sale of Altera\").\nTable:\n(in thousands of U.S. Dollars)\tYear Ended December 31,\t\n\t2019\t2018\nNet operating cash flows\t383,306\t182,135\nNet financing cash flows\t(382,229)\t434,786\nNet investing cash flows\t(50,391)\t(663,456)",

During 2019, we had a net cash outflow of $227.3 million relating primarily to prepayments of short-term and long-term debt, issuance costs and payments on maturity of cross currency swaps, net of proceeds from the issuances of short-term and long-term debt, compared to net cash inflow of $553.7 million in 2018. Scheduled repayments decreased by $438.1 million in 2019 compared to 2018. Historically, the Daughter Entities have distributed operating cash flows to their owners in the form of distributions or dividends. There were no equity financing transactions from the Daughter Entities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Teekay LNG repurchased $25.7 million of common units in the year ended December 31, 2019. Teekay Parent did not raise capital through equity financing transactions in December 31, 2019, compared to $103.7 million raised in 2018 from issuances of new equity to the public, thirdparty investors and two entities established by our founder (including Resolute, our largest shareholder). Cash dividends paid decreased by $16.6 million in 2019, as a result of the elimination of Teekay Parent's quarterly dividend on Teekay’s common stock commencing with the quarter ended March 31, 2019. Investing Cash Flows During 2019, we received $100 million from Brookfield for the sale of our remaining interests in Altera (please read \"Item 18 – Financial Statements: Note 4 – Deconsolidation and Sale of Altera\"). We incurred capital expenditures for vessels and equipment of $109.5 million primarily for capitalized vessel modifications and shipyard construction installment payments in Teekay LNG. Teekay LNG received proceeds of $11.5 million from the sale of the Alexander Spirit and contributed $72.4 million to its equity-accounted joint ventures and loans to joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily to fund project expenditures in the Yamal LNG Joint Venture and the Bahrain LNG Joint Venture. During 2019, Teekay Tankers received proceeds of $19.6 million related to the sale of one Suezmax tanker. During 2018, we incurred capital expenditures for vessels and equipment of $0.7 billion, primarily for capitalized vessel modifications and shipyard construction installment payments. Teekay Parent advanced $25.0 million to Altera in the form of a senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Teekay LNG received proceeds of $54.4 million from the sale of Teekay LNG's 50% ownership interest in the Excelsior Joint Venture and $28.5 million from the sales of the European Spirit and African Spirit. Teekay LNG contributed $40.5 million to its equityaccounted joint ventures and loans to joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily to fund project expenditures in the Yamal LNG Joint Venture, the Bahrain LNG project, and the Pan Union Joint Venture, and for working capital requirements for the MALT Joint Venture. Teekay incurred a net $25.3 million cash outflow as a result of the 2017 Brookfield Transaction (please read \"Item 18 – Financial Statements: Note 4 – Deconsolidation and Sale of Altera\").\nTable:\n(in thousands of U.S. Dollars)\tYear Ended December 31,\t\n\t2019\t2018\nNet operating cash flows\t383,306\t182,135\nNet financing cash flows\t(382,229)\t434,786\nNet investing cash flows\t(50,391)\t(663,456)",

See Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on May 21, 2018, for Management’s Discussions and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the fiscal year ended April 1, 2017. REVENUE Our overall revenue increased $116.8 million in fiscal 2019, compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher demand for our mobile products in support of customers based in China as well as higher demand for our base station products, partially offset by a decrease in revenue due to weakness in marquee smartphone demand experienced by our largest end customer. We provided our products to our largest end customer (Apple) through sales to multiple contract manufacturers, which in the aggregate accounted for 32% and 36% of total revenue in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. Huawei accounted for approximately 13% and 8% of our total revenue in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. These customers primarily purchase RF and Wi-Fi solutions for cellular base stations and a variety of mobile devices, including smartphones, wearables, laptops, tablets and cellular-based applications for the IoT. In May 2019, the U.S. government imposed restrictions on the sales of products to Huawei (see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this report). International shipments amounted to $2,610.0 million in fiscal 2019 (approximately 84% of revenue) compared to $2,449.1 million in fiscal 2018 (approximately 82% of revenue). Shipments to Asia totaled $2,446.3 million in fiscal 2019 (approximately 79% of revenue) compared to $2,329.3 million in fiscal 2018 (approximately 78% of revenue). GROSS MARGIN Gross margin was relatively flat for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, with average selling price erosion offset by favorable changes in product mix. OPERATING EXPENSES Research and Development In fiscal 2019, R&D spending increased $5.4 million, compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher personnel related costs, partially offset by lower product development spend driven by R&D efficiency initiatives. Selling, General and Administrative In fiscal 2019, selling, general and administrative expense decreased $51.7 million, or 9.8%, compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to lower intangible amortization, partially offset by higher personnel related costs. Other Operating Expense In fiscal 2019, other operating expense was $52.2 million. In fiscal 2019, we recognized $15.9 million of asset impairment charges (to adjust the carrying value of certain property and equipment to reflect fair value) and $11.6 million of employee termination benefits as a result of restructuring actions (see Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this report for information on restructuring actions). In fiscal 2019, we also recorded $18.0 million of start-up costs related to new processes and operations in existing facilities. In fiscal 2018, other operating expense was $103.8 million.

In fiscal 2018, we also recorded integration costs and restructuring costs of $6.2 million and $2.6 million, respectively, associated with the Business Combination, as well as $24.3 million of start-up costs related to new processes and operations in both existing and new facilities.

    "context": "Consolidated The table below presents a summary of our results of operations for fiscal years 2019 and 2018. See Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on May 21, 2018, for Management’s Discussions and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the fiscal year ended April 1, 2017. REVENUE Our overall revenue increased $116.8 million in fiscal 2019, compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher demand for our mobile products in support of customers based in China as well as higher demand for our base station products, partially offset by a decrease in revenue due to weakness in marquee smartphone demand experienced by our largest end customer. We provided our products to our largest end customer (Apple) through sales to multiple contract manufacturers, which in the aggregate accounted for 32% and 36% of total revenue in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. Huawei accounted for approximately 13% and 8% of our total revenue in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. These customers primarily purchase RF and Wi-Fi solutions for cellular base stations and a variety of mobile devices, including smartphones, wearables, laptops, tablets and cellular-based applications for the IoT. In May 2019, the U.S. government imposed restrictions on the sales of products to Huawei (see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this report). International shipments amounted to $2,610.0 million in fiscal 2019 (approximately 84% of revenue) compared to $2,449.1 million in fiscal 2018 (approximately 82% of revenue). Shipments to Asia totaled $2,446.3 million in fiscal 2019 (approximately 79% of revenue) compared to $2,329.3 million in fiscal 2018 (approximately 78% of revenue). GROSS MARGIN Gross margin was relatively flat for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, with average selling price erosion offset by favorable changes in product mix. OPERATING EXPENSES Research and Development In fiscal 2019, R&D spending increased $5.4 million, compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher personnel related costs, partially offset by lower product development spend driven by R&D efficiency initiatives. Selling, General and Administrative In fiscal 2019, selling, general and administrative expense decreased $51.7 million, or 9.8%, compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to lower intangible amortization, partially offset by higher personnel related costs. Other Operating Expense In fiscal 2019, other operating expense was $52.2 million. In fiscal 2019, we recognized $15.9 million of asset impairment charges (to adjust the carrying value of certain property and equipment to reflect fair value) and $11.6 million of employee termination benefits as a result of restructuring actions (see Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this report for information on restructuring actions). In fiscal 2019, we also recorded $18.0 million of start-up costs related to new processes and operations in existing facilities. In fiscal 2018, other operating expense was $103.8 million. In fiscal 2018, we initiated restructuring actions to improve operating efficiencies, and, as a result of these actions, we recorded approximately $18.3 million of employee termination benefits and adjusted the carrying value of certain held for sale assets located in China and the U.S. to fair market value (resulting in impairment charges totaling approximately $46.3 million). In fiscal 2018, we also recorded integration costs and restructuring costs of $6.2 million and $2.6 million, respectively, associated with the Business Combination, as well as $24.3 million of start-up costs related to new processes and operations in both existing and new facilities.

In addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors, including a reduced IT spending environment and reductions in spending by government entities, revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition, including the complexity of transactions such as multiple performance obligations; the mix of financing arrangements provided to channel partners and customers; and final acceptance of the product, system, or solution, among other factors.

    "context": "Electro-Magnetic, Sensors, and Actuators The following table sets forth net sales, operating income, and operating income as a percentage of net sales for our MSA reportable segment in fiscal years 2019 and 2018 (amounts in thousands, except percentages). Net Sales MSA net sales of $240.7 million in fiscal year 2019 increased $13.8 million or 6.1% from $227.0 million in fiscal year 2018. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by a $15.0 million increase in OEM sales in the JPKO region. Also contributing to the increase in net sales was a $4.3 million increase in EMS sales across all regions and a $3.7 million increase in distributor sales across the Americas and EMEA regions. These increase in net sales were partially offset by a $5.5 million decrease in distributor sales across the APAC and JPKO regions and a $3.8 million decrease in OEM sales across the Americas, APAC, and JPKO regions. Reportable Segment Operating Income Segment operating income of $22.5 million in fiscal year 2019 increased $6.9 million from $15.7 million in fiscal year 2018. The increase in operating income was primarily due to a $6.6 million decrease in SG&A expenses resulting from a decrease in payroll expenses that was caused by a reduction in head count. Also contributing to the increase in operating income was a $2.9 million decrease in restructuring charges, a $1.3 million decrease in net loss on write down and disposal of long-lived assets, and a $0.2 million decrease in R&D expenses. Partially offsetting these improvements was a $4.1 million decrease in gross margin, which was primarily driven by a change in the sales mix to lower margin products.\nTable:\n\t\tFor the Fiscal Years Ended\t\t\n\tMarch 31, 2019\t\tMarch 31, 2018\t\nSales\tAmount\t% to Net Sales\tAmount\t% to Net Sales\nNet sales\t$240,740\t\t$226,964\t\nSegment operating income\t22,546\t9.4%\t15,694\t6.9%",

components essential to the company's business are generally available from multiple sources , other key components ( including microprocessors and application-specific integrated circuits , or ( \"asics\" ) ) are currently obtained by the company from single or limited sources . some other key components , while currently available to the company from multiple sources , are at times subject to industry- wide availability and pricing pressures . in addition , the company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry , and new products introduced by the company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the company has evaluated whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers . if the supply of a key single-sourced component to the company were to be delayed or curtailed or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays shipments of completed products to the company , the company's ability to ship related products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely affected . the company's business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source , or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source . continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company's requirements . finally , significant portions of the company's cpus , logic boards , and assembled products are now manufactured by outsourcing partners , the majority of which occurs in various parts of asia . although the company works closely

between july 19 , 2000 , and september 28 , 2000 . the complaints allege violations of the 1934 securities exchange act and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief . the company believes these claims are without merit and intends to defend them vigorously . the company filed a motion to dismiss on june 4 , 2002 , which was heard by the court on september 13 , 2002 . on december 11 , 2002 , the court granted the company's motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action , with leave to plaintiffs to amend their complaint within thirty days . the company is

a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition , liquidity or results of operations . however , the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty . should the company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the

obligations are scheduled to start june 2005 . the company's potential liability resulting from the directive related to past sales of its products and expenses associated with future sales of its product may be substantial . however , because it is likely that specific laws , regulations , and enforcement policies will vary significantly between individual european member states , it is not currently possible to estimate the company's existing liability or future expenses resulting from the directive . as the european union and its individual member states clarify specific requirements

consistent carrier investments in their networks across our international markets position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward . in emerging markets , such as ghana , india , nigeria and uganda , wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the united states , and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in underdeveloped areas . a majority of consumers in these markets still utilize basic wireless services , predominantly on feature phones , while advanced device penetration remains low . in more developed urban locations within these markets , early-stage data network deployments are underway . carriers are focused on completing voice network build-outs while also investing in initial data networks as wireless data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate . in markets with rapidly evolving network technology , such as south africa and most of the countries in latin america where we do business , initial voice networks , for the most part , have already been built out , and carriers are focused on 3g network build outs , with select investments in 4g technology . consumers in these regions are increasingly adopting smartphones and other advanced devices , and as a result , the usage of bandwidth-intensive mobile applications is growing materially . recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks . smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are growing rapidly , which typically requires that carriers continue to invest in their networks in order to maintain and augment their quality of service . finally , in markets with more mature network technology , such as germany , carriers are focused on deploying 4g data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage amongst their customer base . with higher smartphone and advanced device penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage , carrier investment in networks is focused on 4g coverage and capacity . we believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the united states , which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years , will ultimately be replicated in our less advanced international markets . as a result , we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 60190 communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier customers to drive sustainable , long-term growth . we have holistic master lease agreements with certain of our tenants that provide for consistent , long-term revenue and a reduction in the likelihood of churn . our holistic master lease agreements build and augment strong strategic partnerships with

    "context": "table of contents recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and begins with a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test prescribed by gaap . for those reporting units where it is required , the first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value . if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount , goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary . to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value , a second step is performed , wherein the reporting unit's carrying value of goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of goodwill . to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value , impairment exists and must be recognized . the calculation of estimated fair value is based on two valuation techniques , a discounted cash flow model ( income approach ) and a market adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues ( market approach ) , with each method being weighted in the calculation . the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination . the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit ( including any unrecognized intangible assets ) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit , as determined in the first step of the goodwill impairment test , was the price paid to acquire that reporting unit . recoverability of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives ( i.e . trademarks ) is determined on a relief from royalty methodology ( income approach ) , which is based on the implied royalty paid , at an appropriate discount rate , to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset . the present value of the after-tax cost savings ( i.e . royalty relief ) indicates the estimated fair value of the asset . any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess . intangible assets such as patents , customer-related intangible assets and other intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives . the weighted-average useful lives approximate the following: .\n\nrecoverability of intangible assets with finite useful lives is assessed in the same manner as property , plant and equipment as described above . income taxes : for purposes of the company 2019s consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the spin-off , income tax expense has been recorded as if the company filed tax returns on a stand-alone basis separate from ingersoll rand . this separate return methodology applies the accounting guidance for income taxes to the stand-alone financial statements as if the company was a stand-alone enterprise for the periods prior to the spin-off . therefore , cash tax payments and items of current and deferred taxes may not be reflective of the company 2019s actual tax balances prior to or subsequent to the spin-off . cash paid for income taxes for the year ended december 31 , 2015 was $ 80.6 million . the income tax accounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 , 2015 and 2014 include income taxes payable and deferred taxes allocated to the company at the time of the spin-off . the calculation of the company 2019s income taxes involves considerable judgment and the use of both estimates and allocations . deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities , applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse . the company recognizes future tax benefits , such as net operating losses and tax credits , to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered in its judgment to be more likely than not . the company regularly reviews the recoverability of its deferred tax assets considering its historic profitability , projected future taxable income , timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the feasibility of its tax planning strategies . where appropriate , the company records a valuation allowance with respect to a future tax benefit . product warranties : standard product warranty accruals are recorded at the time of sale and are estimated based upon product warranty terms and historical experience . the company assesses the adequacy of its liabilities and will make adjustments as necessary based on known or anticipated warranty claims , or as new information becomes available. .\n\nTable:\ncustomer relationships\t25\tyears\ntrademarks\t25\tyears\ncompleted
