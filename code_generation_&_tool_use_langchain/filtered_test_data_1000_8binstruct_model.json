    "context": "AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company has provided a valuation allowance of $194.2 million and $151.9 million, respectively, which primarily relates to foreign items. The increase in the valuation allowance for the year ending December 31, 2019 is due to uncertainty as to the timing of, and the Company\u2019s ability to recover, net deferred tax assets in certain foreign operations in the foreseeable future, offset by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if objective evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as the Company\u2019s projections for growth. A summary of the activity in the valuation allowance is as follows: (1) Includes net charges to expense and allowances established due to acquisition. The recoverability of the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets has been assessed utilizing projections based on its current operations. Accordingly, the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is not dependent on material asset sales or other non-routine transactions. Based on its current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, the Company believes that deferred tax assets, other than those for which a valuation allowance has been recorded, will be realized.\nTable:\n\t2019\t2018\t2017\nBalance as of January 1,\t$151.9\t$142.0\t$144.4\nAdditions (1)\t42.5\t15.7\t11.6\nReversals\t\u2014\t\u2014\t(9.1)\nForeign currency translation\t(0.2)\t(5.8)\t(4.9)\nBalance as of December 31,\t$194.2\t$151.9\t$142.0",

    "context": "Operational performance A Leasing activity We agreed 205 long-term leases in 2019, amounting to \u00a326 million annual rent, at an average of 1 per cent above previous passing rent (like-for-like units) and in line with valuers\u2019 assumptions. On a net effective basis (net of rent frees and incentives), rents were also 1 per cent ahead of previous rents. The upside from these new lettings added to like-for-like net rental income but was lower in magnitude than the negative impacts from administrations and CVAs and increased vacancy (see financial review on pages 30 to 37). Our customers continue to focus on increasing their space in prime, high footfall retail and leisure destinations. Significant activity in 2019 included: \u2014pureplay online brands starting to open stores to increase their physical presence. Morphe, the digital native cosmetics brand, opened three of its six UK stores at intu Victoria Centre, intu Eldon Square and Manchester Arndale, and AliExpress, the consumer platform of Alibaba, opened its first store in Europe at intu Xanad\u00fa \u2014Harrods taking its first shopping centre store, launching a new beauty concept, H Beauty, at intu Lakeside \u2014a new flagship store for Zara at St David\u2019s, Cardiff, where it is moving into the centre from the high street. This follows the recent upsizing of stores at intu Trafford Centre and intu Lakeside \u2014leisure brands increasing their space with Puttshack to open its fourth venue at intu Watford, following its successful opening at intu Lakeside. Namco is expanding its range of attractions at intu Metrocentre with Clip \u2018n Climb and the first Angry Birds Adventure Golf in the UK and Rock Up is taking space at intu Lakeside \u2014international fashion brands continuing to expand in the UK with Spanish brand Mango due to open at intu Watford a B Investment by customers In the year, 256 units opened or refitted in our centres (2018: 262 stores), representing around 8 per cent of our 3,300 units. Our customers have invested around \u00a3125 million in these stores, which we believe is a significant demonstration of their long-term commitment to our centres. C Rent reviews We settled 159 rent reviews in 2019 for new rents totalling \u00a345 million, an average uplift of 6 per cent on the previous rents. D Occupancy Occupancy was 94.9 per cent, in line with June 2019 (95.1 per cent), but a reduction against 31 December 2018 (96.7 per cent), impacted by units closed in the first half of 2019 from tenants who went into administration or through a CVA process in 2018. This had a 3.7 per cent negative impact on like-for-like net rental income in 2019 from both rents foregone and increased void costs. E Weighted average unexpired lease term The weighted average unexpired lease term was 6.3 years (31 December 2018: 7.2 years) illustrating the longevity of our income streams. The reduction against the prior year was primarily due to new lease terms on department stores that have been through a CVA or administration process. F Footfall Footfall in our centres increased by 0.3 per cent in the year. UK footfall was flat, significantly outperforming the Springboard footfall monitor for shopping centres which was down on average by 2.5 per cent. We believe this highlights the continued attraction of our compelling destinations against the wider market. In Spain, footfall was up by 3.5 per cent. G Retailer sales Estimated retailer sales in our UK centres, which totalled \u00a35.2 billion in 2019, were down 1.6 per cent, impacted by some larger space users who have had difficulties and been through CVAs and those brands who operate successful multichannel models where in-store sales figures take no account of the benefit of the store to online sales. This compares favourably to the British Retail Consortium (BRC), where non-food retailer sales in-store were down 3.1 per cent on average in 2019. The ratio of rents to estimated sales for standard units remained stable in 2019 at 12.0 per cent. This does not take into account the benefit to the retailer of their multichannel business, such as click and collect. H Net promoter score Our net promoter score, a measure of visitor satisfaction, ran consistently high throughout 2019 averaging 75, an increase of 2 over 2018. Visitor satisfaction is paramount to a shopper\u2019s likelihood to visit, which in turn drives footfall and extended dwell time. I Gross value of community investment Gross value added, the measure of the economic contribution of intu to the local communities in the UK, remained stable in the year at \u00a34.8 billion. J Carbon emission intensity reduction Annual reduction in carbon emission intensity has reduced in 2019. This is due to our continued focus on energy efficiency to reduce our overall energy demand each year, supported by the ongoing greening of the electricity grid as we become less reliant on coal and increase our renewable generation. Our 2020 target was to reduce carbon emission intensity by 50 per cent, against a 2010 baseline. We reached this target three years ahead of plan and at the end of 2019, our reduction total was 69 per cent.\nTable:\n\tNotes\t2019\t201\nLeasing activity\tA\t\t\n\u2014 number\t\t205\t24\n\u2014 new rent\t\t\u00a326m\t\u00a339m\n\u2014 new rent relative to previous passing rent\t\t+1%\t+6%\nInvestment by customers\tB\t\u00a3125m\t\u00a3144m\nRental uplift on rent reviews settled\tC\t+6%\t+7%\nOccupancy (EPRA basis)\tD\t94.9%\t96.7%\n\u2014 of which, occupied by tenants trading\u00a0in administration\t\t2.8%\t2.0%\nUnexpired lease term\tE\t6.3 years\t7.2 year\nFootfall\tF\t+0.3%\t\u20131.6%\nRetailer sales\tG\t\u20131.6%\t\u20132.3%\nNet promoter score\tH\t75\t7\nGross value added of community investment\tI\t\u00a34.8bn\t\u00a34.8b\nCarbon emission intensity reduction\tJ\t15%\t17%",

    "context": "Deferred taxes arise because of differences in the book and tax bases of certain assets and liabilities. Significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows: At December 31, 2019, undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside the U.S. amounted to approximately $3.8 billion. The majority of Verizon\u2019s cash flow is generated from domestic operations and we are not dependent on foreign cash or earnings to meet our funding requirements, nor do we intend to repatriate these undistributed foreign earnings to fund U.S. operations. Furthermore, a portion of these undistributed earnings represents amounts that legally must be kept in reserve in accordance with certain foreign jurisdictional requirements and are unavailable for distribution or repatriation. As a result, we have not provided U.S. deferred taxes on these undistributed earnings because we intend that they will remain indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. and therefore unavailable for use in funding U.S. operations. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred taxes related to these undistributed earnings is not practicable. At December 31, 2019, we had net after-tax loss and credit carry forwards for income tax purposes of approximately $3.0 billion that primarily relate to state and foreign taxes. Of these net after-tax loss and credit carry forwards, approximately $2.0 billion will expire between 2020 and 2039 and approximately $1.0 billion may be carried forward indefinitely. During 2019, the valuation allowance decreased approximately $481 million.

We also offer quality products such as breakfast sandwiches with freshly cracked eggs, and craveable favorites such as tacos and curly fries, along with specialty sandwiches, salads, and real ice cream shakes, among other items. We allow our guests to customize their meals to their tastes and order any product when they want it, including breakfast items any time of day (or night). We are known for variety and innovation, which has led to the development of four strong dayparts: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late-night. The Jack in the Box restaurant chain was the first major hamburger chain to develop and expand the concept of drive-thru restaurants. In addition to drive-thru windows, most of our restaurants have seating capacities ranging from 20 to 100 people and are open 18-24 hours a day. Drive-thru sales currently account for approximately 70% of sales at company-operated restaurants. The average check in fiscal year2019 was $8.34 for company-operated restaurants. With a presence in only 21 states and one territory, we believe Jack in the Box is a brand with significant growth opportunities. In fiscal 2019, franchisees continued to expand in existing markets. The following table summarizes the changes in the number of company-operated and franchise restaurants over the past five years: Site selections for all new company-operated restaurants are made after an economic analysis and a review of demographic data and other information relating to population density, traffic, competition, restaurant visibility and access, available parking, surrounding businesses, and opportunities for market penetration. Restaurants developed by franchisees are built to brand specifications on sites we have approved. Our company-operated restaurants have multiple restaurant models with different seating capacities to improve our flexibility in selecting locations. Management believes that this flexibility enables the Company to match the restaurant configuration with the specific economic, demographic, geographic, or physical characteristics of a particular site. Typical costs to develop a traditional restaurant, excluding the land value, range from approximately$1.4 million to $2.0 million. The majority of our corporate restaurants are constructed on leased land or on land that we purchase and subsequently sell, along with the improvements, in sale and leaseback transactions.

Our Products and Licensing segment revenues increased $22.5 million to $44.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase resulted primarily from $10.8 million of revenues realized from the legacy business of MOI and $10.5 million of revenues realized from the legacy business of GP during the year ended December 31, 2019. Continued growth in sales of our fiber-optic sensing products, including our ODiSI products directed toward the expanding use of composite materials and the need for improved means of testing their structural integrity, and our communications test instruments also contributed to this increase. Our Technology Development segment revenues increased $5.1 million to $26.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Revenues within this segment increased due to additional contract awards, including higher value Phase 2 SBIR contracts. The increase continues a growth trend experienced over the past two years largely driven by successes in Phase 2 SBIR awards. The increase was realized primarily in our intelligent systems, advanced materials, optical systems and terahertz research groups.

    "context": "Key Balance Sheet Information Total assets increased $1,234.7 million as at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018, principally due to a $485.5 million increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities mainly as a result of the public offering in September 2019, which resulted in net proceeds of $688.0 million. Business acquisitions during the year, largely due to the acquisition of 6RS, further impacted total assets through an increase in goodwill of $273.8 million, a $141.2 million increase in intangible assets and a resulting decrease in cash due to the consideration paid. The remainder of the increase is due to: the adoption of the new lease accounting standard, further discussed in the \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" section below, which resulted in the addition of right-of-use assets totaling $134.8 million as at December 31, 2019; a $58.3 million increase in merchant cash advances and loans receivable; a $49.8 million increase in property and equipment, largely related to leaseholds for our offices; a $49.2 million increase in trade and other receivables largely due to an increase in indirect taxes receivable, unbilled revenue related to subscription fees for Plus merchants, transaction fees and shipping charges; and a $19.4 million increase in deferred tax assets. Total liabilities increased by $309.7 million, principally as a result of the adoption of the new leasing standard, which resulted in $126.8 million of additional lease liabilities related to obtaining right-of-use assets. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by $84.2 million, which was due to an increase in indirect taxes payable, payroll liabilities, and payment processing and interchange fees, partly offset by a decrease in foreign exchange forward contract liabilities. The increase was also due to income taxes payable of $69.4 million driven largely by the one-time capital gain recognized in the period. Deferred tax liabilities increased by $7.6 million, due to the acquisition of 6RS. The growth in sales of our subscription solutions offering, along with the acquisition of 6RS, resulted in an increase of deferred revenue of $21.6 million.\nTable:\n\tDecember 31, 2019\tDecember 31, 2018\n\t(in thousands)\t\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\t$2,455,194\t$1,969,670\nTotal assets\t3,489,479\t2,254,785\nTotal liabilities\t473,745\t164,017\nTotal non-current liabilities\t157,363\t25,329",

    "context": "Note 15. Stock-Based Compensation The following table summarizes the components of non-cash stock-based compensation expense (in thousands): 2015 Equity Incentive Plan We issue stock options pursuant to our 2015 Plan. The 2015 Plan allows for the grant of stock options to employees and for the grant of nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, or RSUs, performance-based stock awards, and other forms of equity compensation to our employees, directors and non-employee directors and consultants. In June 2015, our board of directors adopted and our stockholders approved our 2015 Plan pursuant to which we initially reserved a total of 4,700,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the 2015 Plan, which included shares of our common stock previously reserved for issuance under our Amended and Restated 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, or the 2009 Plan. The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2015 Plan will automatically increase on January 1 each year, for a period of not more than ten years, commencing on January 1, 2016 through January 1, 2024, by 5% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year, or a lesser number of shares as may be determined by the board of directors. As a result of the adoption of the 2015 Plan, no further grants may be made under the 2009 Plan. As of December 31, 2019, 6,527,550 shares remained available for future grant under the 2015 Plan. Stock Options Stock options under the 2015 Plan have been granted at exercise prices based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock options under the 2009 Plan were granted at exercise prices as determined by the board of directors to be the fair market value of our common stock. Our stock options generally vest over a five-year period and each option, if not exercised or forfeited, expires on the tenth anniversary of the grant date. Certain stock options granted under the 2015 Plan and previously granted under the 2009 Plan may be exercised before the options have vested. Unvested shares issued as a result of early exercise are subject to repurchase by us upon termination of employment or services at the original exercise price. The proceeds from the early exercise of stock options are initially recorded as a current liability and are reclassified to common stock and additional paid-in capital as the awards vest and our repurchase right lapses. There were 250 and 957 unvested shares of common stock outstanding subject to our right of repurchase as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We repurchased 27 and 107 of these unvested shares of common stock related to early exercised stock options in connection with employee terminations during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We recorded less than $0.1 million in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets for the proceeds from the early exercise of the unvested stock options as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. We account for stock-based compensation options based on the fair value of the award as of the grant date. We recognize stock-based compensation expense using the accelerated attribution method, net of actual forfeitures, in which compensation cost for each vesting tranche in an award is recognized ratably from the service inception date to the vesting date for that tranche. We value our stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the risk-free interest rate, expected term, expected stock price volatility and dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates for constant maturity U.S. Treasury securities consistent with the expected term of our stock options. The expected term represents the period of time the stock options are expected to be outstanding and is based on the \"simplified method.\" Under the \"simplified method,\" the expected term of an option is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. We use the \"simplified method\" due to the lack of sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to otherwise estimate the expected term of the stock options. Beginning in November 2019, the expected volatility for options granted is based on historical volatilities of our stock over the estimated expected term of the stock options. The expected volatility for options granted prior to November 2019 was based on historical volatilities of our stock and publicly traded stock of comparable companies over the estimated expected term of the stock options. There were 186,500, 219,450 and 252,100 stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We declared and paid dividends in June 2015 in anticipation of our IPO, which we closed on July 1, 2015. Subsequent to the IPO, we do not expect to declare or pay dividends on a recurring basis. As such, we assume that the dividend rate is 0%.\nTable:\n\t\tYear Ended December 31,\t\n\t2019\t2018\t2017\nStock options and assumed options\t$3,783\t$3,511\t$3,913\nRestricted stock units\t16,627\t9,770\t3,366\nRestricted stock awards\t\u2014\t1\t19\nEmployee stock purchase plan\t193\t147\t115\nTotal stock-based compensation expense\t$20,603\t$13,429\t$7,413\nTax benefit from stock-based awards\t$5,154\t$7,581\t$12,719",

This legislation made significant changes in U.S. tax law, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate, changes to net operating loss carryforwards and carrybacks and a repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax. The legislation reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result of the enacted Tax Act, we were required to revalue deferred tax assets and liabilities at the rate in effect when the deferred tax balances are scheduled to reverse. This revaluation resulted in an additional $8.8 million of income tax expense and a corresponding reduction in the deferred tax asset which was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017. Additionally, on December 22, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, or SAB 118, to address the application of GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act.

    "context": "DESCRIPTION OF THE PLANS ESP The ESP is designed to encourage employees of BCE and its participating subsidiaries to own shares of BCE. Each year, employees can choose to have a certain percentage of their eligible annual earnings withheld through regular payroll deductions for the purchase of BCE common shares. In some cases, the employer also will contribute a percentage of the employee\u2019s eligible annual earnings to the plan, up to a specified maximum. Dividends are credited to the participant\u2019s account on each dividend payment date and are equivalent in value to the dividends paid on BCE common shares. The ESP allows employees to contribute up to 12% of their annual earnings with a maximum employer contribution of 2%. Employer contributions to the ESP and related dividends are subject to employees holding their shares for a two-year vesting period. The trustee of the ESP buys BCE common shares for the participants on the open market, by private purchase or from treasury. BCE determines the method the trustee uses to buy the shares. At December\u00a031, 2019, 4,360,087\u00a0common shares were authorized for issuance from treasury under the ESP. The following table summarizes the status of unvested employer contributions at December\u00a031,\u00a02019 and 2018.

    "context": "2019 vs 2018 The decrease in tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, resulted primarily from a decline in pre-tax earnings coupled with favorable benefits from the settlement of international tax audits and changes in estimate in tax expense recorded upon finalizing U.S. tax returns. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of stock based compensation related to shortfalls that occurred during the year as well as the impact of limitations on current and future deductions for certain executive officers under IRC section 162(m). During fiscal year 2019, the Company evaluated the impact of the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income \u201cGILTI\u201d, Foreign Derived Intangible Income \u201cFDII\u201d and Base Erosion and Anti-abuse Tax \u201cBEAT\u201d provisions. These provisions resulted in a net addition to tax of $1.7 million. This amount is comprised of BEAT of $2.1 million offset by the impact of GILTI and FDII of $(0.4) million. For fiscal year 2018, the company estimated that these provisions would result on a net benefit of $(0.3) million. Included in the 2019 tax expense is a benefit of $(0.7) million related to the net impact of these provisions as reported on the final U.S. tax return for the year ended December 31, 2018. 2018 vs 2017 The decrease in the effective tax rate and the decrease in tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, resulted primarily from the combination of a decline in pre-tax earnings and the decrease in the US federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, and the impact of other provisions of the tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Additionally, tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 included the effect of the implementation of certain aspects of the Tax Act including recording provisional expense for the transition tax of $21.7 million for US federal and state income tax purposes. Additionally, the Company recorded tax expense of $26.6 million resulting from the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets resulting from the reduction in US federal tax rate. These items resulted in higher tax expense during fiscal 2017. During fiscal year 2018, the Company completed the computation of the transition tax as part of the 2017 income tax returns filing and reduced the federal and state provisional amount by $6.7 million. The Company has also evaluated the impact of the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income \u201cGILTI\u201d, Foreign Derived Intangible Income \u201cFDII\u201d and Base Erosion and Anti-abuse Tax \u201cBEAT\u201d provisions and as a result recorded a detriment of $0.4 million and a benefit of $(0.7) million in relation to GILTI and FDII respectively, resulting on a net benefit of $(0.3) million. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded tax expense of $23.0 million in continuing operations related to the write-off of deferred tax assets for which the underlying assets and liabilities related to Arlo.

The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed herein do not have standard meaning and may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies or how we may calculate those measures in other instances from time to time. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Also, our \u201ccore\u201d financial measures should not be construed as an inference by us that our future results will be unaffected by those items that are excluded from our \u201ccore\u201d financial measures.

Among other uses, management uses non-GAAP \u201ccore\u201d financial measures to make operating decisions, assess business performance and as a factor in determining certain employee performance when evaluating incentive compensation. We determine the tax effect of the items excluded from \u201ccore\u201d earnings and \u201ccore\u201d diluted earnings per share based upon evaluation of the statutory tax treatment and the applicable tax rate of the jurisdiction in which the pre-tax items were incurred, and for which realization of the resulting tax benefit, if any, is expected. In certain jurisdictions where we do not expect to realize a tax benefit (due to existing tax incentives or a history of operating losses or other factors resulting in a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets), a reduced or 0% tax rate is applied. We are reporting \u201ccore\u201d operating income, \u201ccore\u201d earnings and \u201ccore\u201d return on invested capital to provide investors with an additional method for assessing operating income and earnings, by presenting what we believe are our \u201ccore\u201d manufacturing operations. A significant portion (based on the respective values) of the items that are excluded for purposes of calculating \u201ccore\u201d operating income and \u201ccore\u201d earnings also impacted certain balance sheet assets, resulting in a portion of an asset being written off without a corresponding recovery of cash we may have previously spent with respect to the asset. In the case of restructuring and related charges, we may make associated cash payments in the future. In addition, although, for purposes of calculating \u201ccore\u201d operating income and \u201ccore\u201d earnings, we exclude stock-based compensation expense (which we anticipate continuing to incur in the future) because it is a non-cash expense, the associated stock issued may result in an increase in our outstanding shares of stock, which may result in the dilution of our stockholders\u2019 ownership interest. We encourage you to consider these matters when evaluating the utility of these non-GAAP financial measures. Included in the tables below are a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures as provided in our Consolidated Financial Statements: Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP Financial Results to Non-GAAP Measures (1) Charges during fiscal years 2019 and 2018 relate to inventory and other assets charges for certain distressed customers in the networking and consumer wearables sectors.

Net Income (Loss) per Share The Company calculates basic earnings per share by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The diluted earnings per share is computed by giving effect to all potential dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period using the treasury stock method. For purposes of this calculation, options to purchase common stock, stock awards, and the Convertible Senior Notes are considered to be common stock equivalents. Since the Company has the intent and ability to settle the principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes in cash and any excess in shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, the Company uses the treasury stock method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the conversion spread on diluted net income per share, if applicable.

Derivative financial instruments with a positive market value are reported within this note as are contract assets, which represent an asset for accrued revenue in respect of goods or services delivered to customers for which a trade receivable does not yet exist. Accounting policies Trade receivables represent amounts owed by customers where the right to payment is conditional only on the passage of time. Trade receivables that are recovered in instalments from customers over an extended period are discounted at market rates and interest revenue is accredited over the expected repayment period. Other trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value. When the Group establishes a practice of selling portfolios of receivables from time to time these portfolios are recorded at fair value through other comprehensive income; all other trade receivables are recorded at amortised cost The carrying value of all trade receivables, contract assets and finance lease receivables recorded at amortised cost is reduced by allowances for lifetime estimated credit losses. Estimated future credit losses are first recorded on the initial recognition of a receivable and are based on the ageing of the receivable balances, historical experience and forward looking considerations. Individual balances are written off when management deems them not to be collectible. Notes: 1 Previously described as accrued income in the year ended 31 March 2018 2 Items are measured at fair value and the valuation basis is level 2 classification, which comprises items where fair value is determined from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly The Group\u2019s trade receivables and contract assets are classified at amortised cost unless stated otherwise and are measured after allowances for future expected credit losses, see note 21 \u201cCapital and financial risk management\u201d for more information on credit risk.

    "context": "Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is managed to enable the Group to meet future payment obligations when financial liabilities fall due. Liquidity analysis is conducted to determine that sufficient headroom is available to meet the Group\u2019s operational requirements and committed investments. The Group treasury policy aims to meet this objective by maintaining adequate cash, marketable securities and committed facilities. Undrawn borrowing facilities are detailed in note 23. The Group\u2019s policy is to seek to optimise its exposure to liquidity risk by balancing its exposure to interest rate risk and to refinancing risk. In effect the Group seeks to borrow for as long as possible at the lowest acceptable cost. Group policy is to maintain a weighted average debt maturity of over five years. At 31 December 2019, the maturity profile of Group debt showed an average maturity of five years (2018: six years). The Group regularly reviews the maturity profile of its borrowings and seeks to avoid concentration of maturities through the regular replacement of facilities and by arranging a selection of maturity dates. Refinancing risk may be reduced by doing so prior to the contracted maturity date. The change in valuation of an asset used as security for a debt facility may impact the Group\u2019s ability to refinance that debt facility at the same quantum as currently outstanding. The Group does not use supplier financing arrangements to manage liquidity risk.

Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $10.2 million to $106.5 million in 2019 compared to $116.7 million in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to:\n\u2022 lower contribution recognized from our participation in the Cool Pool due to lower utilization and a higher number of drydocking days for our vessels for the year ended December 31, 2019;\n\u2022 $24.9 million of drydocking costs as the majority of our fleet was scheduled for dry-dock during 2019;\n\u2022 $9.3 million in cash receipts in connection with arbitration proceedings with a former charterer of the Golar Tundra, compared to $50.7 million recovered in 2018; and\n\u2022 the reduction in the general timing of working capital in 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. This was partially offset by receipts of $4.0 million in relation to a loss of hire insurance claim on the Golar Viking. There were no comparable receipts in 2018. Cash provided by operating activities increased by $151.8 million to $116.7 million in 2018 compared to cash utilized of $35.1 million in 2017. The increase in cash utilized in 2018 was primarily due to: \u2022 higher contributions recognized from our participation in the Cool Pool as a result of improved utilization and daily hire rates from the Cool Pool vessels; \u2022 lower charterhire payments as a result of the expiry of the charter-back arrangement of the Golar Grand from Golar Partners in November 2017; \u2022 $50.7 million in cash receipts in connection with arbitration proceedings with a former charterer of the Golar Tundra; and \u2022 the improvement on the general timing of working capital in 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. Net cash used in investing activities Net cash used in investing activities of $264.4 million in 2019 comprised mainly of:\n\u2022 $376.3 million of payments made in respect of the conversion of the Gimi into a FLNG;\n\u2022 $21.0 million additional investments in Golar Power and Avenir; and\n\u2022 $24.4 million of payments predominately for the installation of the ballast water treatment systems on eight of our vessels. This was partially offset by receipts of:\n\u2022 $115.2 million of proceeds from Keppel's initial subscription and subsequent cash calls in relation to its 30% equity interest in Gimi MS;\n\u2022 $29.2 million of dividends received from Golar Partners; and\n\u2022 $9.7 million of cash consideration received from Golar Partners in respect of the remaining net purchase price less working capital adjustments in connection with the Hilli acquisition. Net cash used in investing activities of $202.5 million in 2018 comprised mainly of:\n\u2022 the addition of $116.7 million to asset under development relating to payments made in respect of the conversion of the Hilli into a FLNG; and\n\u2022 additions of $95.5 million to investments in affiliates, which relates principally to capital contributions made to Golar Power of $55.0 million and our investment in Avenir of $24.8 million; and\n\u2022 additions to vessels and equipment of $33.1 million. This was partially offset by: \u2022 receipt of $9.7 million from Golar Partners in relation to the Hilli Disposal; and \u2022 $33.2 million of dividends received from Golar Partners. Net cash (used in)/provided by financing activities Net cash used in financing activities is principally generated from funds from new debt, debt refinancings, debt repayments and cash dividends. Net cash used in financing activities of $136.0 million in 2019 arose primarily due to: \u2022 scheduled debt repayments of $443.1 million; \u2022 $100.0 million repayment of the Margin Loan following refinancing; \u2022 $9.1 million repayment upon the extension of the Golar Arctic facility; \u2022 payment of dividends of $65.0 million; \u2022 financing costs of $24.5 million predominately in relation to the Gimi debt facility; and \u2022 payment of $18.6 million in relation to the 1.5 million treasury shares repurchased on our equity swap in November 2019. This was partially offset by debt proceeds drawn down of:\n\u2022 $100.0 million on the new Margin Loan facility;\n\u2022 $150.0 million on the term loan facility;\n\u2022 $130.0 million on the Gimi facility; and\n\u2022 $144.3 million in relation to our lessor VIE's. Net cash provided by financing activities of $177.4 million in 2018 arose primarily due to proceeds of $1.2 billion from our debt facilities, including:\n\u2022 $115.0 million further drawdown on the pre-delivery financing in relation to the conversion of the Hilli into a FLNG;\n\u2022 $960.0 million drawdown on the post-acceptance Hilli sale and leaseback financing in relation to the Hilli Facility; and\n\u2022 $101.0 million of debt proceeds drawn down by the lessor VIE, which owns the Golar Crystal, upon refinancing of its debt into a long-term loan facility.

The Company estimates the expected term of share options for service-based awards utilizing the \u201cSimplified Method,\u201d as it does not have sufficient historical share option exercise information on which to base its estimate. The Simplified Method is based on the average of the vesting tranches and the contractual life of each grant. The risk-free interest rate is based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected life of the share option. Since there was no public market for the Company\u2019s ordinary shares prior to the IPO and as its shares have been publicly traded for a limited time, the Company determined the expected volatility for options granted based on an analysis of reported data for a peer group of companies that issue options with substantially similar terms. The expected volatility of options granted has been determined using an average of the historical volatility measures of this peer group of companies. The Company uses an expected dividend rate of zero as it currently has no history or expectation of paying dividends on its ordinary shares. The fair value of the Company\u2019s ordinary shares at the time of each share option grant is based on the closing market value of its ordinary shares on the grant date.

We expect cash inflows from operating activities to be primarily affected by increases in total bookings. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for domain registration costs paid to registries, software licensing fees related to third-party email and productivity solutions, personnel costs, discretionary marketing and advertising costs, technology and development costs and interest payments. We expect cash outflows from operating activities to be affected by the timing of payments we make to registries and increases in personnel and other operating costs as we continue to grow our business and increase our international presence. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $163.6 million from $559.8 million in 2018 to $723.4 million in 2019, primarily driven by our bookings growth as well as increased interest income. Investing Activities Our investing activities primarily consist of strategic acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment to support the overall growth of our business and our increased international presence. We expect our investing cash flows to be affected by the timing of payments we make for capital expenditures and the strategic acquisition or other growth opportunities we decide to pursue. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $119.5 million from $254.8 million in 2018 to $135.3 million in 2019, primarily due to a $106.9 million decrease in business acquisitions. Financing Activities Our financing activities primarily consist of long-term debt borrowings, the repayment of principal on long-term debt, stock option exercises and share repurchases. Net cash from financing activities decreased $503.9 million from $47.0 million provided in 2018 to $456.9 million used in 2019, primarily resulting from $458.6 million of share repurchases in 2019, a $44.4 million increase in acquisition contingent consideration payments and $13.2 million of financing-related costs paid in 2019.\nTable:\n\tYear Ended December 31,\t\t\n\t2019\t2018\t2017\nNet cash provided by operating activities\t$723.4\t$559.8\t$475.6\nNet cash used in investing activities\t(135.3)\t(254.8)\t(1,570.1)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\t(456.9)\t47.0\t1,107.5\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\t(0.8)\t(2.3)\t3.6\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents\t$130.4\t$349.7\t$16.6",

Effective in 2018, the Tax Act reduced the United States statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and created new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings and certain related-party payments, which are referred to as the global intangible low-taxed income tax and the base erosion tax, respectively. In addition, in 2017 we were subject to a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to income tax in the United States. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, we made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional expense of $15.3 million in our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 in accordance with guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\u201cSAB 118\u201d), which allows a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. This provisional expense included $10.1 million expense for the remeasurement of deferred tax balances to reflect the lower federal rate and expense of $5.2 million for the one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to income tax in the United States. Adjustments to these provisional amounts that we recorded in 2018 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. Our accounting for the effects of the enactment of U.S. Tax Reform is now complete. Due to our divestiture of our investment in Netsmart, the amounts noted above do not include the provisional amounts recorded by Netsmart in 2017.

    "context": "12. RESTRICTED CASH AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSITS Our restricted cash and short-term deposits balances are as follows: (1) Restricted cash relating to the share repurchase forward swap refers to the collateral required by the bank with whom we entered into a total return equity swap. Collateral of 20% of the total purchase price is required and this is subsequently adjusted with reference to the Company's share price. In November 2019, we purchased 1.5 million shares underlying the total return equity swap that resulted in $54.7 million of restricted cash being released (see note 24). (2) In November 2015, in connection with the issuance of a $400 million letter of credit by a financial institution to our project partner involved in the Hilli FLNG project, we posted an initial cash collateral sum of $305.0 million to support the performance guarantee. Under the provisions of the $400 million letter of credit, the terms allow for a stepped reduction in the value of the guarantee over time and thus, conversely, a reduction in the cash collateral requirements. In 2017, the $400 million letter of credit and the cash collateral requirement was reduced to $300 million and $174.6 million, respectively, with no further reduction in 2018. In 2019, the letter of credit was reduced to $250.0 million and a contractual amendment further reduced the letter of credit to $125.0 million and the cash collateral to $76.0 million. There is no further contractual reduction expected until 2021. In November 2016, after certain conditions precedent were satisfied by the Company, the letter of credit required in accordance with the signed LTA was re-issued and, with an initial expiry date of December 31, 2018, the letter of credit automatically extends, on an annual basis, until the tenth anniversary of the acceptance date of the Hilli by the charterer, unless the bank should exercise its option to exit from this arrangement by giving three months' notice prior to the annual renewal date. (3) These are amounts held by lessor VIE entities that we are required to consolidate under U.S. GAAP into our financial statements as VIEs (see note 5). (4) This refers to cash deposits required under the $1.125 billion debt facility (see note 18). The covenant requires that, on the second anniversary of drawdown under the facility, where we fall below a prescribed EBITDA to debt service ratio, additional cash deposits with the financial institution are required to be made or maintained. (5) Collateral held against the Margin Loan facility is required to satisfy one of the mandatory prepayment events within the facility, with this having been triggered when the closing price of the Golar Partners common units pledged by us as security for the obligations under the facility fell below a defined threshold. If certain requirements are met, the facility allows for the release of the collateral (see note 18).

All other cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortised cost. Note: 1 Items are measured at fair value and the valuation basis is level 1 classification, which comprises financial instruments where fair value is determined by unadjusted quoted prices in active markets. The carrying amount of balances at amortised cost approximates their fair value. Cash and cash equivalents of \u20ac1,381 million (2018: \u20ac1,449 million) are held in countries with restrictions on remittances but where the balances could be used to repay subsidiaries\u2019 third party liabilities.\nTable:\n\t2019\t2018\n\t\u20acm\t\u20acm\nCash at bank and in hand\t2,434\t2,197\nRepurchase agreements and bank deposits\t2,196\t\u2013\nMoney market funds1\t9,007\t2,477\nCash and cash equivalents as presented in the statement of financial position\t13,637\t4,674\nBank overdrafts\t(32)\t(7)\nCash and cash equivalents of discontinued operations\t\u2013\t727\nCash and cash equivalents as presented in the statement of cash flows\t13,605\t5,394",

    "context": "Fiscal 2018 compared to Fiscal 2017 Net Sales Overall, our net sales were $7.94 billion in fiscal 2018, an increase of 1% compared to fiscal 2017. Grocery & Snacks net sales for fiscal 2018 were $3.29 billion, an increase of $78.2 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2017. Results reflected a decrease in volumes of approximately 2% in fiscal 2018 compared to the prior-year period, excluding the impact of acquisitions. The decrease in sales volumes reflected a reduction in promotional intensity, planned discontinuation of certain lower-performing products, retailer inventory reductions, which were higher than anticipated, and deliberate actions to optimize distribution on certain lower-margin products, consistent with the Company's value over volume strategy. Price/ mix was flat compared to the prior-year period as favorable mix improvements from recent innovation and higher net pricing nearly offset continued investments in retailer marketing to drive brand saliency, enhanced distribution, and consumer trial. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC contributed $68.1 million to Grocery & Snacks net sales during fiscal 2018. The Frontera acquisition contributed $8.6 million and the Thanasi acquisition contributed $66.5 million to Grocery & Snacks net sales during fiscal 2018 through the one-year anniversaries of the acquisitions. The Frontera and Thanasi acquisitions occurred in September 2016 and April 2017, respectively. Refrigerated & Frozen net sales for fiscal 2018 were $2.75 billion, an increase of $100.3 million, or 4%, compared to fiscal 2017. Results for fiscal 2018 reflected a 3% increase in volume compared to fiscal 2017, excluding the impact of 31 acquisitions. The increase in sales volumes was a result of brand renovation and innovation launches. Price/mix was flat compared to fiscal 2017, as favorability in both net pricing and mix offset continued investment in retailer marketing to drive brand saliency, enhanced distribution, and consumer trial. The acquisition of the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin\u00ae business contributed $21.3 million to Refrigerated & Frozen's net sales during fiscal 2018. The Frontera acquisition, which occurred in September 2016, and subsequent innovation in the Frontera\u00ae brand contributed $4.4 million during fiscal 2018 through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. International net sales for fiscal 2018 were $843.5 million, an increase of $27.5 million, or 3%, compared to fiscal 2017. Results for fiscal 2018 reflected a 3% decrease in volume, a 3% increase due to foreign exchange rates, and a 3% increase in price/mix, in each case compared to fiscal 2017. The volume decrease for fiscal 2018 was driven by strategic decisions to eliminate lower margin products and to reduce promotional intensity. The increase in price/mix compared to the prior-year period was driven by improvements in pricing and trade productivity. Foodservice net sales for fiscal 2018 were $1.05 billion, a decrease of $23.5 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2017. Results for fiscal 2018 reflected an 11% decrease in volume, partially offset by a 9% increase in price/mix compared to fiscal 2017. The decrease in volumes compared to the prior year primarily reflected the impact of exiting a non-core business, the planned discontinuation of certain lower-performing businesses, and softness in certain categories. The increase in price/mix for fiscal 2018 reflected favorable product and customer mix, the impact of inflation-driven increases in pricing, and the execution of the segment's value over volume strategy. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we divested our Spicetec and JM Swank businesses. These businesses comprise the entire Commercial segment following the presentation of Lamb Weston as discontinued operations. Accordingly, there were no net sales in the Commercial segment after the first quarter of fiscal 2017.

The acquisitions presented below are not material, but the Company gives the information to provide the reader a summarized view of the content of the acquisitions made. The acquisitions consist primarily of: Kathrein: On October 2, 2019, the Company acquired assets from Kathrein, a world leading provider of antenna and filter technologies with approximately 4,000 employees. Kathrein\u2019s antenna and filters business has a strong R&D organization with extensive experience in antenna design and research, coupled with a strong IPR portfolio. In addition to broadening Ericsson\u2019s portfolio of antenna and filter products, the acquisition will bring vital competence for the evolution of advanced radio network products. The acquired Kathrein business has had a negative impact of SEK \u20130.5 billion since the acquisition, corresponding to \u20131 percentage point in Networks operating margin. Balances to facilitate the Purchase price allocation are preliminary. CSF: On August 20, 2019, the Company acquired 100% of the shares in CSF Holdings Inc. a US-based technology company with approximately 25 employees. CSF strengthens iconectiv\u2019s Business to Consumer (B2C) product platforms to enable growth in messaging and Toll-Free Number (TFN) management. Balances to facilitate the Purchase price allocation are final. ST-Ericsson: Before ST-Ericsson was a joint venture where Ericsson and ST Microelectronics had a 50/50 ownership. This joint venture consisted of a number of legal entities where the two parties owned different stakes in the different legal entities. In December 2019 the Company initiated transactions to wind-down the legal structure of ST-Ericsson by acquiring the remaining shares in two legal ST-Ericsson entities and costs of SEK \u20130.3 billion impacted the result. The Company now owns 100% of the shares in those entities. In order to finalize a Purchase price allocation all relevant information needs to be in place.

    "context": "Note 9 \u2013 Debt Obligations Debt obligations as of December 27, 2019 and December 28, 2018 consisted of the following: Senior Secured Term Loan Credit Facility On June 22, 2016, the Company refinanced its debt structure by entering into a credit agreement (the \u201cTerm Loan Credit Agreement\u201d) with a group of lenders for which Jefferies Finance LLC acts as administrative agent and collateral agent. The Term Loan Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured term loan B facility (the \u201cTerm Loan Facility\u201d) in an aggregate amount of $305,000 (the loans outstanding under the Term Loan Facility, the \u201cTerm Loans\u201d) maturing on June 22, 2022. Additionally, the Term Loan Facility includes an accordion which permits the Company to request that the lenders extend additional Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $50,000 (less the aggregate amount of certain indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions) plus an unlimited amount subject to the Company\u2019s Total Leverage Ratio not exceeding 4.90:1.00 on a pro forma basis. Borrowings were used to repay the Company\u2019s senior secured notes, as well as the prior term loan and revolving credit facility. Remaining funds were used for capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions, working capital and general corporate purposes of the Company. On December 13, 2017, the Company completed a repricing of the Term Loan Facility to reduce Applicable Rate (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) from 475 basis points to 400 basis points over the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). In connection with the repricing, the Company paid debt financing costs of $761 which were capitalized as deferred financing charges. On July 6, 2018, the Company made a $47,100 prepayment and is no longer required to make quarterly amortization payments on the Term Loans. On November 16, 2018, the Company completed a repricing of the Term Loan Facility to reduce the Applicable Rate from 400 basis points to 350 basis points over LIBOR. In connection with the repricing, the Company paid debt financing costs of $626 which were capitalized as deferred financing charges. The Company wrote off unamortized deferred financing fees of $1,081 as a result of this repricing. The interest charged on the Term Loans, will be equal to a spread plus, at the Company\u2019s option, either the Base Rate (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) or LIBOR for one, two, three, six or (if consented to by the lenders) twelve-month interest periods chosen by the Company. The interest rate on the Term Loans at December 27, 2019 was 5.2%. The Term Loan Facility contains customary affirmative covenants, negative covenants (including restrictions, subject to customary exceptions, on incurring debt or liens, paying dividends, repaying payment subordinated and junior lien debt, disposing assets, and making investments and acquisitions), and events of default for a term loan B facility of this type, as more particularly described in the Term Loan Credit Agreement. As of December 27, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants under the Term Loan Credit Agreement. Asset-Based Loan Facility On June 29, 2018, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the \u201cABL Credit Agreement\u201d) with a group of lenders for which BMO Harris Bank, N.A. acts as administrative agent. The ABL Credit Agreement provides for an asset-based loan facility (the \u201cABL\u201d) in the aggregate amount of up to $150,000. Borrowings under the ABL will be used, and are expected to be used, for capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions, working capital and general corporate purposes of the Company. Availability under the ABL will be limited to a borrowing base equal to the lesser of: (i) the aggregate amount of commitments or (ii) the sum of specified percentages of eligible receivables and eligible inventory, minus certain availability reserves. The co-borrowers under the ABL are entitled on one or more occasions, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to request an increase in the commitments under the ABL in an aggregate principal amount of up to $25,000. The ABL matures on the earlier of June 29, 2023 and 90 days prior to the maturity date of the Company\u2019s Term Loan Facility. The interest rate charged on borrowing under the ABL is equal to a spread plus, at the Company\u2019s option, either the Base Rate (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) or LIBOR (except for swingline loans) for one, two, three, six or (if consented to by the lenders) twelve-month, interest periods chosen by the Company. The Company will pay certain recurring fees with respect to the ABL, including fees on unused lender commitments. The ABL Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, negative covenants and events of default as more particularly described in the ABL Credit Agreement. The Company is required to comply with a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 1:1 if the amount of availability under the ABL falls below $10,000 or 10% of the borrowing base. The Company incurred transaction costs of $877 which were capitalized as deferred financing fees to be amortized over the term of the ABL. On July 6, 2018, the Company borrowed $47,100 under the ABL and made an equivalent prepayment on its Term Loans. On November 22, 2019, the Company fully paid all borrowings outstanding under the ABL and there was no balance outstanding as of December 27, 2019. The weighted average interest rate on our ABL borrowings was approximately 3.7% during fiscal 2019. As of December 27, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants and the Company had reserved $16,641 of the ABL for the issuance of letters of credit. As of December 27, 2019, funds totaling $133,359 were available for borrowing under the ABL. Convertible Senior Notes On November 22, 2019, the Company issued $150,000 aggregate principal amount of 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes (the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d). The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of November 22, 2019 (the \u201cIndenture\u201d), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. Approximately $43,225 of the net proceeds were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under the ABL and the Company intends to use the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes, which may include future acquisitions. The Senior Notes bear interest of 1.875% per annum payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2020. At any time before the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, the Senior Notes will be convertible at the option of holders into shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, together with cash in lieu of any fractional share, at an initial conversion price of approximately $44.20 per share. The conversion price is subject to adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. The Senior Notes will mature on December 1, 2024, unless earlier converted or repurchased in accordance with their terms. The Company may not redeem the Senior Notes at its option prior to maturity. In addition, if the Company undergoes a fundamental change, as described in the Indenture, holders may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or part of their Senior Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the required repurchase date. The Company incurred transaction costs of approximately $5,082 which were capitalized as deferred financing fees to be amortized over the term of the Senior Notes. Convertible Unsecured Note On February 25, 2019, the Company issued a $4,000 convertible unsecured note (the \u201cUnsecured Note\u201d), maturing on June 29, 2023, to Bassian Farms, Inc. (the \u201cHolder\u201d) as partial consideration in the Bassian acquisition. The interest rate charged on the Unsecured Note is 4.5% per annum and increases to 5.0% after the two-year anniversary of the closing date. The Company may, in certain instances beginning eighteen months after issuance of the Unsecured Note, redeem the Unsecured Note in whole or in part for cash or convert the Unsecured Note into shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at the conversion price of $43.93 per share. After the two-year anniversary of the closing date, the Holder may convert the Unsecured Note into shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at the conversion price. Upon a change of control event, the Holder may convert the Unsecured Note into shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at the conversion price or redeem the Unsecured Note for cash.\nTable:\n\tDecember 27, 2019 \tDecember 28, 2018\nSenior secured term loan\t$238,129\t$239,745\nConvertible senior notes \t150,000\t\u2014\nConvertible unsecured note \t4,000\t\u2014\nFinance lease and other financing obligations\t3,905\t193\nAsset-based loan facility \t\u2014\t44,185\nDeferred finance fees and original issue discount \t(9,207)\t(5,893)\nTotal debt obligations\t386,827\t278,230\nLess: current installments \t(721)\t(61)\nTotal debt obligations excluding current installments\t$386,106\t$278,169",

When we receive a notice of conversion for any of our convertible notes and elect to settle in cash any amount of the conversion obligation in excess of the principal amount, the cash settlement obligations become derivative debt liabilities subject to mark-to-market accounting treatment based on the volume-weighted-average price of our common stock over a period of 20 consecutive trading days. Accordingly, at the date of our election to settle a conversion in cash, we reclassify the fair value of the equity component of the converted notes from additional capital to derivative debt liability within current debt in our consolidated balance sheet. In 2018, we repurchased or redeemed $6.96 billion of principal amount of notes (carrying value of $6.93 billion) for an aggregate of $9.42 billion in cash and 4 million shares of our treasury stock. As of August 30, 2018, an aggregate of $35 million principal amount of our 2033F Notes (with a carrying value of $165 million) had converted but not settled.

In periods with a net income from continuing operations attributable to Cubic, diluted EPS is computed by dividing the net income for the period by the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Common equivalent shares consist of dilutive RSUs. Dilutive RSUs are calculated based on the average share price for each fiscal period using the treasury stock method. For RSUs with performance-based vesting, no common equivalent shares are included in the computation of diluted EPS until the related performance criteria have been met. For RSUs with performance and market-based vesting, no common equivalent shares are included in the computation of diluted EPS until the performance criteria have been met, and once the criteria are met the dilutive restricted stock units are calculated using the treasury stock method, modified by the multiplier that is calculated at the end of the accounting period as if the vesting date was at the end of the accounting period. The multiplier on RSUs with performance and market-based vesting is further described in Note 16. In periods with a net loss from continuing operations attributable to Cubic, common equivalent shares are not included in the computation of diluted EPS, because to do so would be anti-dilutive.

Management believes that Insurance AOI and Pretax Insurance AOI measures provide investors with meaningful information for gaining an understanding of certain results and provide insight into an organization\u2019s operating trends and facilitates comparisons between peer companies. However, Insurance AOI and Pre-tax Insurance AOI have certain limitations, and we may not calculate it the same as other companies in our industry. It should, therefore, be read together with the Company's results calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Similarly to Adjusted EBITDA, using Insurance AOI and Pre-tax Insurance AOI as performance measures have inherent limitations as an analytical tool as compared to income (loss) from operations or other U.S. GAAP financial measures, as these non-U.S. GAAP measures exclude certain items, including items that are recurring in nature, which may be meaningful to investors. As a result of the exclusions, Insurance AOI and Pre-tax Insurance AOI should not be considered in isolation and do not purport to be an alternative to income (loss) from operations or other U.S. GAAP financial measures as measures of our operating performance. Management defines Pre-tax Insurance AOI as Insurance AOI adjusted to exclude the impact of income tax (benefit) expense recognized during the current period. Management believes that Insurance AOI and Pre-tax Insurance AOI provide meaningful financial metrics that help investors understand certain results and profitability. While these adjustments are an integral part of the overall performance of the Insurance segment, market conditions impacting these items can overshadow the underlying performance of the business. Accordingly, we believe using a measure which excludes their impact is effective in analyzing the trends of our operations. The table below shows the adjustments made to the reported Net income (loss) of the Insurance segment to calculate Insurance AOI and Pre-tax Insurance AOI (in millions). Refer to the analysis of the fluctuations within the results of operations section: (1) The Insurance segment revenues are inclusive of realized and unrealized gains and net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Such adjustments are related to transactions between entities under common control which are eliminated or are reclassified in consolidation. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $105.8 million to $59.4 million from $165.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Pre-tax Insurance AOI for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $85.1 million to $85.7 million from $0.6 million for year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by the incremental net investment income and policy premiums from the KIC block acquisition and higher net investment income from the legacy CGI block driven by both the growth and mix of the investment portfolio, including premium reinvestment and rotation into higher yield assets. In addition, there was a decrease in policy benefits, changes in reserves, and commissions related to current period reserve adjustments driven by higher mortality and policy terminations, an increase in contingent non-forfeiture option activity as a result of in-force rate actions approved and implemented, and favorable developments in claims activity. This was partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily attributable to headcount additions related to the KIC acquisition.\nTable:\n\t\tYear ended December 31,\t\n\t\t\tIncrease /\n\t2019\t2018\t(Decrease)\nNet income - Insurance segment\t$59.4\t$165.2\t$(105.8)\nEffect of investment (gains) (1)\t(1.9)\t(5.6)\t3.7\nAsset impairment expense\t47.3\t\u2014\t47.3\nGain on bargain purchase\t(1.1)\t(115.4)\t114.3\nGain on reinsurance recaptures\t\u2014\t(47.0)\t47.0\nAcquisition costs\t2.1\t2.8\t(0.7)\nInsurance AOI\t105.8\t\u2014\t105.8\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\t(20.1)\t0.6\t(20.7)\nPre-tax Insurance AOI\t$85.7\t$0.6\t$85.1",

    "context": "Orders for Digital Industries declined due to lower demand in the short-cycle factory automation and motion control businesses, which faced increasingly adverse market conditions during the course of the fiscal year, particularly in the automotive and machine building industries. These declines were only partly offset by clear growth in the process automation business and a moderate increase in the software business, which was due to positive currency translation effects and new volume from recent acquisitions, particularly including Mendix. The latter two businesses were also the drivers for revenue growth, as year-overyear revenue growth for the short-cycle businesses in the first half of fiscal 2019 gave way to declines in the second half. On a geographic basis, orders declined in the regions Europe, C. I. S., Africa, Middle East and in the Americas, only partly offset by an increase in the Asia, Australia region. Revenue rose in all three reporting regions. The software business strengthened its contribution to Adjusted EBITA with a double-digit increase. Higher expenses related to new cloud-based offerings were partly offset by a \u20ac 50 million gain from the sale of an equity investment. The process automation business showed a moderate increase in Adjusted EBITA, due mainly to higher revenue. Nevertheless, Adjusted EBITA for Digital Industries overall came in slightly lower year-over-year due to clear declines in the short-cycle businesses. Severance charges were \u20ac 92 million in fiscal 2019, up from \u20ac 75 million a year earlier. Digital Industries\u2019 order backlog was \u20ac 5 billion at the end of the fiscal year, of which \u20ac 4 billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal 2020. Digital Industries achieved its results in a market environment that lost momentum in the course of fiscal 2019. In particular, demand for investment goods eroded notably in the second half of the fiscal year. All regions were impacted by the slowdown, and countries with strong focus on investment goods and strong export ties to China suffered notably. While process industries still benefited from positive development of raw material prices, discrete industries faced headwinds from low demand including destocking effects. The automotive industry was hit by production cuts in Europe and weak demand in China. This, among other factors, also impacted the machine building industry, particularly affecting customers in Germany and Japan. Production\ngrowth in the pharmaceutical and chemicals industries flattened\nduring the course of fiscal 2019, due in part to spillover effects from the automotive industry on related chemicals segments. The food and beverage industry grew modestly and global electronics and semiconductor production expanded but prices were under pressure. For fiscal 2020, the market environment for Digital Industries is expected to weaken further. Manufacturing investments are expected to decrease at least moderately but then begin to stabilize in the second half of fiscal 2020. An overall decline in investment sentiment caused by global trade tensions, among other factors, dampens short-term expectations and fuels increasing cautiousness for investments globally. A weakening of growth in China could lead to spillover effects in other Asian\ncountries and also in Europe.\nTable:\n\t\tFiscal year\t\t% Change\n(in millions of \u20ac)\t2019\t2018\tActual\tComp.\nOrders\t15,944\t16,287\t(2) %\t(4) %\nRevenue\t16,087\t15,587\t3 %\t2 %\ntherein: software business\t4,039\t3,560\t13%\t8%\nAdjusted EBITA\t2,880\t2,898\t(1) %\t\nAdjusted EBITA margin\t17.9 %\t18.6 %\t\t",

S. dollar. The increase in other current financial assets was driven by higher loans receivable at SFS, which were mainly due to new business and reclassification of non-current loans receivable from other financial assets. While higher loans receivable and receivables from finance leases from new business at SFS contributed also to growth in other financial assets, a large extent of the overall increase resulted from increased fair values of derivative financial instruments. Inventories increased in several industrial businesses, with the build-up most evident at SGRE, Mobility and Siemens Healthineers. Assets classified as held for disposal increased mainly due to reclassification of two investments from investments accounted for using the equity method. The increase in goodwill included the acquisition of Mendix. Deferred tax assets increased mainly due to income tax effects related to remeasurement of defined benefits plans. The increase in other assets was driven mainly by higher net defined benefit assets from actuarial gains.\nTable:\n\t\tSep 30,\t\n(in millions of \u20ac)\t2019\t2018\t% Change\nCash and cash equivalents\t12,391\t11,066\t12 %\nTrade and other receivables\t18,894\t18,455\t2 %\nOther current financial assets\t10,669\t9,427\t13 %\nContract assets\t10,309\t8,912\t16 %\nInventories\t14,806\t13,885\t7 %\nCurrent income tax assets\t1,103\t1,010\t9 %\nOther current assets\t1,960\t1,707\t15 %\nAssets classified as held for disposal\t238\t94\t154 %\nTotal current assets\t70,370\t64,556\t9 %\nGoodwill\t30,160\t28,344\t6 %\nOther intangible assets\t9,800\t10,131\t(3) %\nProperty, plant and equipment\t12,183\t11,381\t7 %\nInvestments accounted for using the equity method\t2,244\t2,579\t(13) %\nOther financial assets\t19,843\t17,774\t12 %\nDeferred tax assets\t3,174\t2,341\t36 %\nOther assets\t2,475\t1,810\t37 %\nTotal non-current assets\t79,878\t74,359\t7 %\nTotal assets\t150,248\t138,915\t8 %",

We completed the accounting for the Tax Act during Q3 fiscal 2019 and recorded an adjustment on December 31, 2018 of $0.2 million to increase our deferred tax liability associated with certain indefinite lived intangibles. We have elected to account for global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) inclusions in the period in which they are incurred. Our tax provision includes a provision for income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions where subsidiaries are profitable, but only a minimal benefit is reflected related to U.S. and certain foreign tax losses due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of future benefits from these losses. The 2019 tax provision results primarily from foreign tax expense, the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions and the completion of our accounting for the Tax Act. The 2019 tax provision differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, state taxes and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. The 2018 tax provision primarily results from a reduction in the deferred rate and the ability to offset indefinite lived deferred tax liabilities with certain deferred tax assets due to passage of the Tax Act. The 2018 effective rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of the Tax Act, recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, certain foreign and state tax effects including a benefit of $0.4 million related to a settlement with the California Franchise Tax Board and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. The 2017 tax provision primarily results from state taxes, taxes withheld in foreign jurisdictions and foreign tax expense. The 2017 tax provision differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, state taxes and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences.\nTable:\n(In thousands)\t2019\t2018\t2017\nIncome tax benefit at the US Federal statutory rate\t$(2,718)\t$(3,654)\t$(4,019)\nBenefit for state taxes\t(304)\t(642)\t(142)\nImpact of foreign operations\t(310)\t38\t158\nIndefinite life assets\t130\t335\t102\nOfficer life insurance\t3\t(5)\t(6)\nChange in valuation allowance\t3,302\t3,328\t4,007\nChange in liability for unrecognized tax benefits\t(400)\t40\t9\nImpact of Tax Act, net\t226\t(3,287)\t\u2014\nMeals and entertainment\t60\t81\t163\nEquity\t2\t476\t\u2014\nGlobal intangible low-taxed income\t94\t\u2014\t\u2014\nOther\t136\t39\t(36)\nTotal income tax expense (benefit)\t$221\t$(3,251)\t$236",

Net Sales MSA net sales of $240.7 million in fiscal year 2019 increased $13.8 million or 6.1% from $227.0 million in fiscal year 2018. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by a $15.0 million increase in OEM sales in the JPKO region. Also contributing to the increase in net sales was a $4.3 million increase in EMS sales across all regions and a $3.7 million increase in distributor sales across the Americas and EMEA regions. These increase in net sales were partially offset by a $5.5 million decrease in distributor sales across the APAC and JPKO regions and a $3.8 million decrease in OEM sales across the Americas, APAC, and JPKO regions. Reportable Segment Operating Income Segment operating income of $22.5 million in fiscal year 2019 increased $6.9 million from $15.7 million in fiscal year 2018. The increase in operating income was primarily due to a $6.6 million decrease in SG&A expenses resulting from a decrease in payroll expenses that was caused by a reduction in head count. Also contributing to the increase in operating income was a $2.9 million decrease in restructuring charges, a $1.3 million decrease in net loss on write down and disposal of long-lived assets, and a $0.2 million decrease in R&D expenses.

The $230.9 million decrease was the result of the recapture of reinsurance treaties by our Insurance segment in 2018 and was offset in part by improved performance of the Insurance segment subsequent to the KIC acquisition, significant reduction of losses at the Broadcasting segment driven by the cost cutting measures, and an increase in the working capital at our Telecommunications segments. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $263.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to cash used in investing activities of $224.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $39.1 million increase in cash used was a result of (i) an increase in net cash spent at our Insurance segment driven by purchases of investments from the residual cash received from the KIC acquisition and reinsurance recaptures in 2018, (ii) a decrease in cash proceeds received at our Life Sciences segment, from the 2018 upfront payment and 2019 escrow release related to the sale of BeneVir in the prior period, and (iii) an increase in cash used at our Energy segment to acquire ampCNG stations in 2019. These decreases were largely offset by a reduction in cash used by our Construction segment, driven by the acquisition of GrayWolf in 2018, and a reduction in cash used by our Broadcasting segment as less cash was used on its acquisitions in the current year compared to 2018. This was largely offset by a reduction in net cash used by the Insurance segment's purchases of investments, as in the prior period the Insurance segment purchased investments from the cash received from the acquisition of KIC. Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities was $62.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $115.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $52.8 million decrease was a result of a decrease in net borrowings by the Construction and Broadcasting segments, and offset in part by the increase in net borrowings by the Energy segment and Corporate segment, and a decline in cash paid to noncontrolling interest holders driven by the proceeds from our Life Sciences segment's sale of BeneVir in 2018.\nTable:\nYears Ended December 31,\t\t\t\n\t2019\t2018\tIncrease / (Decrease)\nOperating activities\t$110.5\t$341.4\t$(230.9)\nInvesting activities\t(263.7)\t(224.6)\t(39.1)\nFinancing activities\t62.4\t115.2\t(52.8)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\t1.0\t(0.5)\t1.5\nNet decrease in cash,cash equivalents and restricted cash\t$(89.8)\t$231.5\t$(321.3)",

    "context": "In assessing the ability to realize our deferred tax assets, we considered whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We considered the following: we have historical cumulative book income, as measured by the current and prior two years; we have strong, consistent taxpaying history; we have substantial U.S. federal income tax carryback potential; and we have substantial amounts of scheduled future reversals of taxable temporary differences from our deferred tax liabilities. We have concluded that this positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence and, thus, that the deferred tax assets as of March 29, 2019 are realizable on a \u2018\u2018more likely than not\u2019\u2019 basis. The aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows: There was a change of $68 million in gross unrecognized tax benefits during fiscal 2019. This gross liability does not include offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, interest deductions, and state income taxes. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits at March 29, 2019, $361 million, if recognized, would favorably affect our effective tax rate. We recognize interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. At March 29, 2019, before any tax benefits, we had $43 million of accrued interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits. Interest included in our provision for income taxes was an expense of approximately $17 million for fiscal 2019. If the accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable, amounts accrued will be reduced in the period that such determination is made and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision. We file income tax returns in the U.S. on a federal basis and in many U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. Our most significant tax jurisdictions are the U.S., Ireland, and Singapore. Our tax filings remain subject to examination by applicable tax authorities for a certain length of time following the tax year to which those filings relate. Our fiscal years 2014 through 2019 remain subject to examination by the IRS for U.S. federal tax purposes. Our fiscal years prior to 2014 have been settled and closed with the IRS. Our 2015 through 2019 fiscal years remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Irish tax purposes, and our 2014 through 2019 fiscal years remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Singapore tax purposes. The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year. Although potential resolution of uncertain tax positions involves multiple tax periods and jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to these audits could decrease (whether by payment, release, or a combination of both) in the next 12 months by $26 million. Depending on the nature of the settlement or expiration of statutes of limitations, we estimate $26 million could affect our income tax provision and therefore benefit the resulting effective tax rate. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing income tax controversies and the impact, if any, of the expected tolling of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.\nTable:\n\t\tYear Ended\t\n(In millions)\tMarch 29, 2019\tMarch 30, 2018\tMarch 31, 2017\nBalance at beginning of year\t$378\t$248\t$197\nSettlements with tax authorities\t(3)\t(4)\t(23)\nLapse of statute of limitations\t(17)\t(3)\t(9)\nIncrease related to prior period tax positions\t16\t35\t21\nDecrease related to prior period tax positions\t(11)\t\u2014\t(9)\nIncrease related to current year tax positions\t75\t98\t38\nIncrease due to acquisition\t8\t4\t33\nNet increase\t68\t130\t51\nBalance at end of year\t$446\t$378\t$248",

Sales in 2018 were higher in the U.S. primarily due to system development on the New York New Fare Payment System contract, which was awarded in October 2017. Increased work on both development and service contracts, including work on new change orders in London also increased CTS sales for the year. Sales were also positively impacted in the U.K. and Australia due to the impact of exchange rates. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in an increase in CTS sales of $12.4 million for 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the strengthening of the British Pound against the U.S. dollar. Amortization of Purchased Intangibles: Amortization of purchased intangibles included in the CTS operating results totaled $5.2 million in 2018 and $5.7 million in 2017. Operating Income: CTS operating income increased 52% in 2018 to $60.4 million compared to $39.8 million in 2017. For 2018, operating income was higher from increased volumes of system development work and services, including work on new projects and change orders, primarily in North America and the U.K. Operating income was also higher due to operational efficiencies and reductions in R&D spending. R&D expenses for CTS in 2017 included $6.4 million of system development expenses related to our anticipated contract with the New York Metropolitan Transit Authority that was awarded in early fiscal 2018; such expenses incurred in 2018 on this contract are classified as cost of sales.

As of December 31, 2019, we had $2.7 million of cash restricted as to use to collateralize outstanding letters of credit. Cash Flows From Operating Activities. We calculate our cash flows from operating activities beginning with net income, adding back the impact of non-cash items or nonoperating activity (e.g., depreciation, amortization, amortization of OID, impairments, gain/loss from debt extinguishments, deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation, etc.), and then factoring in the impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities. Our primary source of cash is from our operating activities. Our current business model consists of a significant amount of recurring revenue sources related to our long-term cloud-based and managed services arrangements (mostly billed monthly), payment process transaction services (mostly billed monthly), and software maintenance agreements (billed monthly, quarterly, or annually). This recurring revenue base provides us with a reliable and predictable source of cash. In addition, software license fees and professional services revenues are sources of cash, but the payment streams for these items are less predictable.

    "context": "Accounts receivable and contract balances The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the time of billing to customers. Receivables presented in the balance sheet represent an unconditional right to consideration. Contract balances represent amounts from an arrangement when either the performance obligation has been satisfied by transferring goods and/or services to the customer in advance of receiving all or partial consideration for such goods and/or services from the customer, or the customer has made payment in advance of obtaining control of the goods and/or services promised to the customer in the contract. Contract assets primarily relate to rights to consideration for goods and/or services provided to the customers but for which there is not an unconditional right at the reporting date. Under a fixed-term plan, the total contract revenue is allocated between wireless services and equipment revenues, as discussed above. In conjunction with these arrangements, a contract asset is created, which represents the difference between the amount of equipment revenue recognized upon sale and the amount of consideration received from the customer. The contract asset is recognized as accounts receivable as wireless services are provided and billed. The right to bill the customer is\n\nobtained as service is provided over time, which results in the right to the payment being unconditional. The contract asset balances are presented in the balance sheets as prepaid expenses and other, and other assets - net. Contract assets are assessed for impairment on an annual basis and an impairment charge is recognized to the extent the carrying amount is not recoverable. The impairment charge related to contract assets was insignificant for\u00a0the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Increases in the contract asset balances were primarily due to new contracts and increases in sales promotions recognized upfront, driven by customer activity related to wireless services, while decreases were due to reclassifications to accounts receivable due to billings on the existing contracts and insignificant impairment charges. Contract liabilities arise when customers are billed and consideration is received in advance of providing the goods and/or services promised in the contract. The majority of the contract liability at each year end is recognized during the following year as these contract liabilities primarily relate to advanced billing of fixed monthly fees for service that are recognized within the following month when services are provided to the customer. The contract liability balances are presented in the balance sheet as contract liabilities and other, and other liabilities.

Under the Option Plan, awards are made to eligible executives and other management personnel who have an impact on the Group\u2019s performance. Option Plan awards are delivered in the form of options over shares, which vest over a period of three years subject to meeting performance measures and continuous employment with the Company. Each option is to subscribe for one ordinary share when the option is exercised and, when issued, the shares will rank equally with other shares. Unless the terms on which an option was offered specified otherwise, an option may be exercised at any time after the vesting date on satisfaction of the relevant performance criteria. Options issued under the Employee Share Option Plan are valued on the same basis as those issued to KMP, which is described in Note 16(d). There were no new options issued under the Option Plan during the 30 June 2019 and 30 June 2018 financial years, as the Option Plan was replaced with the Rights Plan as described in Note 16(b).

Therefore, the Board had exercised its discretion during the year to extend the expiry date for the remaining options to 30 September 2018. 2.

    "context": "Deferred tax (liabilities) assets are comprised of the following at: The Company has Federal tax credit carryforwards of $5.4 million that expire in various tax years from 2028 to 2038. The Company has a Federal operating loss carryforward of $24.5 million expiring from 2029 through 2037 and a Federal operating loss carryforward of $17.9 million with an unlimited carryforward period. The Company also has state tax credit carryforwards of $0.3 million and state operating loss carryforwards of $43.3 million, which vary by jurisdiction and expire in various tax years through 2039. In assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. As a result of this analysis and based on the current year\u2019s taxable income, and utilization of certain carryforwards management determined an increase in the valuation allowance in the current year to be appropriate. In calculating the valuation allowance, the Company was not permitted to use its existing deferred tax liabilities related to its indefinite-lived intangible assets (i.e. \u201cnaked credit deferred tax liabilities\u201d) as a source of taxable income to support the realization of its existing finite-lived deferred tax assets. Due to the Tax Act, U.S. net operating losses (\"NOLs\") arising in tax years ending after December 31, 2017 will no longer be subject to the limited 20-year carryforward period. Under the new law, these NOLs carry forward indefinitely, resulting in the creation of indefinite-lived deferred tax assets. Consequently, as the Company schedules its deferred taxes and considers the ability to realize its deferred tax assets in future periods, it needs to consider how existing deferred tax assets, other than historical NOLs, will reverse. If the reversal is expected to generate an indefinite carryforward NOL under the new law, this may impact the valuation allowance assessment. The indefinite carryforward period for NOLs also means that its deferred tax liabilities related to indefinite-lived intangibles, commonly referred to as \u201cnaked credits,\u201d can be considered as support for realization. The adjustment for the 2019 \u201cnaked credit\u201d resulted in a $0.01 million deferred tax liability. In 2019, it was determined that the foreign tax credit carryforward of the Company would not be realizable. The reduction of the foreign tax credit carryforward resulted in a decrease in the valuation allowance for those credits. Therefore, there is no net income tax provision in 2019 related to the reduction in the foreign tax credit carryforward. A valuation allowance is required to the extent it is more likely than not that the future benefit associated with certain Federal and state tax loss carryforwards will not be realized. The current year income tax provision includes a reduction of the Company\u2019s valuation allowance due to the establishment of a deferred tax liability in connection with the issuance of convertible debt. The establishment of that deferred tax liability created \u201cfuture taxable income\u201d for the utilization of existing deferred tax assets of the Company, resulting in the $4 million reduction of the Company\u2019s valuation allowance. The Company records the benefits relating to uncertain tax positions only when it is more likely than not (likelihood of greater than 50%), based on technical merits, that the position would be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold are measured using a probability-weighted approach as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. At December 31, 2019, the Company\u2019s reserve for uncertain tax positions is not material and we believe we have adequately provided for its tax-related liabilities. The Company is no longer subject to United States federal income tax examinations for years before 2014.\nTable:\n\tDecember 31,\t\n\t(in thousands)\t\n\t2019\t2018\nDeferred tax (liabilities) assets:\t\t\nSubordinated debt\t$(3,659)\t$\u2014\nIndefinite lived intangibles\t(64)\t\u2014\nRight of use assets\t(756)\t\u2014\nSoftware development costs\t(1,219)\t(1,954)\nAcquired intangible assets\t(446)\t(676)\nDepreciation on property, plant and equipment\t(352)\t\u2014\nGross deferred tax liabilities\t(6,496)\t(2,630)\nAllowances for bad debts and inventory\t3,013\t2,785\nCapitalized inventory costs\t141\t116\nIntangible assets\t117\t420\nEmployee benefit accruals\t2,427\t1,742\nInterest Limitation\t1,248\t\u2014\nLease liabilities\t772\t\u2014\nFederal net operating loss carryforward\t8,563\t6,512\nState net operating loss carryforward\t2,317\t2,112\nTax credit carryforwards\t5,777\t6,176\nDepreciation on property, plant and equipment\t\u2014\t373\nOther\t912\t722\nGross deferred tax assets\t25,287\t20,958\nLess valuation allowance\t(18,855)\t(18,328)\nNet deferred tax liabilities\t$(64)\t$\u2014",

The table below sets forth the Company\u2019s contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers. The increase in the contract assets balance during the period was primarily due to $203 million of revenue recognized that was not billed, in accordance with the terms of the contracts, as of December 31, 2019, offset by $193 million of contract assets included in the December 31, 2018 balance that were invoiced to Nielsen\u2019s clients and therefore transferred to trade receivables. The decrease in the contract liability balance during the period was primarily due to $326 million of advance consideration received or the right to consideration that is unconditional from customers for which revenue was not recognized during the period, offset by $337 million of revenue recognized during the period that had been included in the December 31, 2018 contract liability balance.\nTable:\n(IN MILLIONS)\tYear Ended December 31,\t\n\t2019\t2018\nContract assets\t$218\t$210\nContract liabilities\t$346\t$359",

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate is $68.2. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were $1.8 in 2019 and are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties were $8.7 at December 31, 2019 and $6.9 at December 31, 2018. During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by a net $6.3, mainly due to anticipated statute of limitations lapses in various jurisdictions. The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to examinations for U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in various state, city and foreign jurisdictions. The Company\u2019s federal income tax returns for 2016 through the current period remain open to examination and the relevant state, city and foreign statutes vary. The Company does not expect the assessment of any significant additional tax in excess of amounts reserved. The Tax Act was signed into U.S. law on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act contains provisions which impact the Company\u2019s income taxes including a reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a one-time deemed mandatory repatria- tion tax imposed on all undistributed foreign earnings, and the introduction of a modified territorial taxation system. The SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\u201cSAB 118\u201d) on December 22, 2017 to provide guidance where the accounting under ASC 740, Income Taxes, is incomplete for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act upon issuance of financial statements for the reporting period in which the Tax Act was enacted. SAB 118 provides that if a company could determine a reasonable estimate, that estimate should be reported as a provisional amount and adjusted during a measurement period. If a company is unable to determine a reasonable estimate, no related provisional amounts would be recorded until a reasonable estimate can be determined, within the measurement period. The measurement period extends until all necessary information has been obtained, prepared, and analyzed, but no longer than 12-months from the date of enactment of the Tax Act. The Company intends to distribute all historical unremitted foreign earnings up to the amount of excess foreign cash, as well as all future foreign earnings that can be repatriated without incremental U.S. federal tax cost. Any remaining outside basis differences relating to the Company\u2019s investments in foreign subsidiaries are no longer expected to be material and will be indefinitely reinvested.\nTable:\n\t2019\t2018\t2017\nBeginning balance\t$ 63.6\t$ 52.2\t$ 38.7\nAdditions for tax positions of prior periods\t2.9\t2.4\t24.8\nAdditions for tax positions of the current period\t4.2\t6.9\t4.2\nAdditions due to acquisitions\t1.9\t4.4\t\u2014\nReductions for tax positions of prior periods\t(0.3)\t(0.4)\t(11.2)\nReductions attributable to settlements with taxing authorities\t\u2014\t\u2014\t(1.5)\nReductions attributable to lapses of applicable statute of limitations\t(2.5)\t(1.9)\t(2.8)\nEnding balance\t$ 69.8\t$ 63.6\t$ 52.2",

In local currency, revenue amounted to US$782.3 million compared to US$662.3 million for fiscal 2018. The increase resulted mainly from: \u2022 the impact of the MetroCast acquisition completed on January 4, 2018 which was included in revenue for only an eight-month period in the prior year; \u2022 rate increases; \u2022 continued growth in Internet service customers; and \u2022 the FiberLight acquisition completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2019; partly offset by \u2022 a decrease in video service customers. Excluding the MetroCast and FiberLight acquisitions, revenue in constant currency increased by 5.2% for fiscal 2019. OPERATING EXPENSES Fiscal 2019 operating expenses increased by 19.5% (15.2% in constant currency) mainly as a result of: \u2022 the impact of the MetroCast acquisition which was included in operating expenses for only an eight-month period in the prior year; \u2022 programming rate increases; \u2022 the FiberLight acquisition completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2019; \u2022 higher compensation expenses due to higher headcount to support growth; and \u2022 higher marketing initiatives to drive primary service units growth; partly offset by \u2022 the prior year's non-recurring costs of $3.1 million (US$2.5 million) related to hurricane Irma.

    "context": "Other non-operating results The following details our other consolidated results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017: Interest income: Interest income increased by $4.2 million to $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $5.9 million for the same period in 2017 due to returns on our fixed deposits that had been made in 2018, and income derived from the lending capital of our lessor VIEs, that we are required to consolidate under U.S. GAAP. Interest expense: Interest expense increased by $42.6 million to $101.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $59.3 million for the same period in 2017. In addition to higher LIBOR rates, this was primarily due to:\n\u2022 $22.7 million increase in interest expense arising on the loan facilities of our consolidated lessor VIEs (refer to note 5 \"Variable Interest Entities (\"VIE\")\" of our consolidated financial statements included herein), in particular on the Hilli post-delivery sale and leaseback arrangement entered into during June 2018;\n\u2022 $21.7 million lower capitalized interest on borrowing costs in relation to our investment in the Hilli FLNG conversion prior to acceptance of the vessel;\n\u2022 $7.0 million increase in amortization of deferred financing costs in relation to the Hilli facility; and\n\u2022 $1.4 million increase in interest expense in relation to the $402.5 million convertible bond issued in February 2017, resulting in a full year of interest incurred in 2018. This was partially offset by a decrease of:\n\u2022 $5.9 million in interest expense relating to the Hilli disposal; and\n\u2022 $5.0 million higher capitalized interest on borrowing costs in relation to our investment in Golar Power. (Losses)/gains on derivative instruments: Losses on derivative instruments increased by $51.2 million to a loss of $30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to a gain of $20.7 million for the same period in 2017. The movement was primarily due to: Net unrealized and realized gains on interest rate swap agreements: As of December 31, 2018, we have an interest rate swap portfolio with a notional amount of $950 million, none of which are designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Net unrealized gains on the interest rate swaps decreased to a gain of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to a gain of $6.6 million for the same period in 2017, due to an improvement in the long-term swap rates, offset by the decreased notional value of the swap portfolio over the period. Realized gains on our interest rate swaps increased to a gain of $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to a loss of $3.8 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher LIBOR rates for the year ended December 31, 2018. Unrealized (losses) gains on Total Return Swap (or equity swap): In December 2014, we established a three month facility for a Stock Indexed Total Return Swap Programme or Equity Swap Line with DNB Bank ASA in connection with a share buyback scheme. The facility has been extended to June 2019. The equity swap derivatives mark-to-market adjustment resulted in a net loss of $30.7 million recognized in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to a gain of $16.6 million for the same period in 2017. The loss in 2018 is due to the fall in our share price during 2018. Unrealized mark-to-market losses on Earn-Out Units: This relates to the mark-to-market movement on the Earn-Out Units issuable in connection with the IDR reset transaction in October 2016, which we recognize as a derivative asset in our consolidated financial statements. The decrease in Golar Partners' quarterly distribution to $0.4042 per common unit on October 24, 2018 resulted in the contingent Earn-Out Units arising out of the IDR reset transaction in October 2016 not crystallizing and, accordingly, we recognized a mark-to-market loss of $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, effectively reducing the derivative asset to $nil at December 31, 2018, compared to a gain of $0.4 million for the same period in 2017. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests: The net income attributable to non-controlling interests comprises of (i) $19.7 million and $1.5 million in relation to the non-controlling shareholders who hold interests in Hilli LLC and Hilli Corp (prior to the incorporation of Hilli LLC) for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and (ii) $43.5 million and $32.9 million in relation to the equity interests in our lessor VIEs for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nTable:\n\t\tDecember 31,\t\t\n(in thousands of $)\t2018\t2017\tChange\t% Change\nTotal other non-operating expense\t\u2014\t(81)\t81\t(100)%\nInterest income\t10,133\t5,890\t4,243\t72%\nInterest expense\t(101,908)\t(59,305)\t(42,603)\t72%\n(Losses)/gains on derivative instruments\t(30,541)\t20,696\t(51,237)\t(248)%\nOther financial items, net\t(1,481)\t(69)\t(1,412)\t2,046%\nIncome taxes\t(1,267)\t(1,505)\t238\t(16)%\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests\t(63,214)\t(34,424)\t(28,790)\t84%",

Net regular interest in the year was \u00a340.5m, a decrease of \u00a33.9m compared to the prior year. Consistent with recent years, the largest component of finance costs in the year was interest due to holders of the Group\u2019s senior secured notes, which was \u00a331.7m. The interest on the senior secured notes was \u00a30.5m lower compared to the prior year following the re-financing of the June 2021 \u00a3325m fixed rate notes at a coupon of 6.5% to the October 2023 \u00a3300m fixed rate notes to the slightly lower coupon of 6.25%. Bank debt interest of \u00a35.1m was \u00a32.1m lower in the year due to lower levels of average debt and a lower margin on the revolving credit facility following the refinancing completed in May 2018. Amortisation of debt issuance costs was \u00a33.7m, \u00a31.3m lower than the prior year due to lower transaction costs associated with the issue of the \u00a3300m 6.25% Fixed rate notes compared with the retired \u00a3325m 6.5% Fixed rate notes.

In the prior year, a \u00a30.4m discount unwind credit relating to long-term property provisions held by the Group due to an increase in gilt yields was reflected in reported Net finance cost.

These repurchases can be conducted on the open market or as private purchases and may include the use of derivative contracts with large financial institutions, in all cases subject to compliance with applicable law. This repurchase program has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Funding for this share repurchase program may be through a combination of cash on hand, cash generation, and borrowings. As of June 30, 2019, we have purchased approximately $2.0 billion of shares under this authorization, $0.5 billion via open market trading and $1.5 billion utilizing accelerated share repurchase arrangements. Accelerated Share Repurchase Agreements On June 4, 2019, we entered into four separate accelerated share repurchase agreements (collectively, the \u201cJune 2019 ASR\u201d) with two financial institutions to repurchase a total of $750 million of Common Stock. We took an initial delivery of approximately 3.1 million shares, which represented 75% of the prepayment amount divided by our closing stock price on June 4, 2019. The total number of shares received under the June 2019 ASR will be based upon the average daily volume weighted average price of our Common Stock during the repurchase period, less an agreed upon discount. Final settlement of the June 2019 ASR is anticipated to occur no later than November 20, 2019. On January 31, 2019, we entered into two separate accelerated share repurchase agreements (collectively, the \u201cJanuary 2019 ASR\u201d) with two financial institutions to repurchase a total of $760 million of Common Stock. We took an initial delivery of approximately 3.3 million shares, which represented 75% of the prepayment amount divided by our closing stock price on January 30, 2019. The total number of shares received under the January 2019 ASR was based upon the average daily volume weighted average price of our Common Stock during the repurchase period, less an agreed upon discount. Final settlement of the agreements occurred during May 2019, resulted in the receipt of approximately 0.8 million additional shares, which yielded a weighted-average share price of approximately $182.32 for the transaction period. Share repurchases, including those under the repurchase program, were as follows: (1) During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, we acquired 0.5 million shares at a total cost of $80.5 million which we withheld through net share settlements to cover minimum tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock unit awards granted under our equity compensation plans. The shares retained by us through these net share settlements are not a part of the Board-authorized repurchase program but instead are authorized under our equity compensation plan.

    "context": "Vessel operations segment (1) TCE is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a reconciliation of TCE, please see \u201cItem 3. Key Information-A. Selected Financial Data.\" Total operating revenues: Operating revenues decreased by $72.3 million to $230.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $303.0 million in 2018. This was principally due to a decrease of:\n\u2022 $90.4 million in revenue as a result of lower utilization, higher number of drydocking days and lower charterhire rates for our fleet for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the majority of our fleet was scheduled for drydocking, resulting in 278 days of off-hire in aggregate, compared to 28 days of off-hire during the same period in 2018; and\n\u2022 $2.3 million decrease in vessel and other management fees revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018, mainly due to the wind down of OneLNG during 2018. This was partially offset by the:\n\u2022 $20.4 million increase in revenue from the Golar Viking as she was mostly on-hire during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to being on commercial waiting time until December 2018. Average daily TCE: As a result of lower voyage expenses offsetting the decrease in operating revenues, the average daily TCE for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased marginally to $44,400 compared to $43,700 for the same period in 2018. Vessel operating expenses: Vessel operating expenses decreased by $2.9 million to $67.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $70.5 million for the same period in 2018, primarily due to a decrease of:\n\u2022 $3.1 million in reactivation and operating costs of the Golar Viking as she was taken out of lay-up in January 2018;\n\u2022 $1.8 million in expenses in relation to the Gandria as a result of the generic works in anticipation of her conversion into a FLNG at the start of 2018; and\n\u2022 $1.1 million in expenses in relation to the Gimi in the year ended December 31, 2019, as we commenced capitalization of costs associated with her conversion to a FLNG following receipt of the Limited Notice to Proceed in December 2018 to service the Gimi GTA Project. This was partially offset by an increase in non-capitalizable vessel operating costs of $2.8 million net increase as a result of the scheduled drydocking in the year ended December 31, 2019. Voyage, charterhire and commission expenses: Largely relates to charterhire expenses, fuel costs associated with commercial waiting time and vessel positioning costs. While a vessel is on-hire, fuel costs are typically paid by the charterer, whereas during periods of commercial waiting time, fuel costs are paid by us. The decrease in voyage, charterhire and commission expenses of $66.1 million to $38.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $104.5 million for the same period in 2018, is principally due to a decrease of:\n\u2022 $56.4 million reduction in voyage expenses as a result of decreased utilization of our vessels; and\n\u2022 $15.2 million reduction in bunker consumption as the majority of our fleet underwent drydocking for a total of 278 days in aggregate, compared to 28 days during the same period in 2018. This was partially offset by the $4.6 million increase in costs in relation to the Golar Arctic, as she was mostly on commercial waiting time for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to full utilization during the same period in 2018. Administrative expenses: Administrative expenses decreased by $0.9 million to $50.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $51.7 million for the same period in 2018, principally due to a decrease in corporate expenses and share options expenses. Project development expenses: Project development expenses decreased by $3.1 million to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $5.2 million for the same period in 2018, principally due to a decrease in non-capitalized project-related expenses comprising of legal, professional and consultancy costs. Depreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization decreased by $0.6 million to $64.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $65.5 million for the same period in 2018, principally due to a decrease of $0.9 million in Golar Viking depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, as a result of a $34.3 million impairment charge on the vessel and equipment recognized in March 2019. Impairment of long-term assets: Impairment of long-term assets increased by $42.1 million for the year ended December 31,\n2019 due to a:\n\u2022 $34.3 million impairment charge on vessel and equipment associated with our LNG carrier, the Golar Viking. In March 2019, we signed an agreement with LNG Hrvatska for the future sale of the Golar Viking once converted into an FSRU, following the completion of its current charter lease term. Although the sale is not expected to close until the fourth quarter of 2020, the transaction triggered an immediate impairment test. As the current carrying value of the vessel exceeds the price that a market participant would pay for the vessel at the measurement date, a non-cash impairment charge of $34.3 million was recognized. The fair value was based on average broker valuations as of the measurement date and represents the exit price in the principal LNG carrier sales market; and\n\u2022 $7.3 million impairment charge associated with our investment in OLT Offshore LNG Toscana S.P.A.

Contract balances are reported in a net contract asset or liability position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.

    "context": "Revenues, Cost of Revenues and Gross Margin by Product Type 1) License: Our license revenue can be broadly categorized as perpetual licenses, term licenses and subscription licenses, all of which are deployed on the customer\u2019s premises (on-premise). Our license revenues are impacted by the strength of general economic and industry conditions, the competitive strength of our software products, and our acquisitions. Cost of license revenues consists primarily of royalties payable to third parties. License revenues decreased by $9.4 million or 2.2% during the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the prior fiscal year; up 0.4% after factoring the impact of $11.2 million of foreign exchange rate changes. Geographically, the overall change was attributable to an increase in Americas of $8.2 million, offset by a decrease in Asia Pacific of $10.6 million and a decrease in EMEA of $7.0 million. During Fiscal 2019, we closed 153 license deals greater than $0.5 million, of which 49 deals were greater than $1.0 million, contributing approximately $144.1 million of license revenues. This was compared to 140 deals greater than $0.5 million during Fiscal 2018, of which 58 deals were greater than $1.0 million, contributing $152.2 million of license revenues. Cost of license revenues increased by $0.7 million during the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the prior fiscal year. The gross margin percentage on license revenues remained at approximately 97%. For illustrative purposes only, had we accounted for revenues under proforma Topic 605, license revenues would have been $390.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2019, which would have been lower by approximately $47.1 million or 10.8% as compared to the prior fiscal year; and would have been lower by 8.4% after factoring the impact of $10.4 million of foreign exchange rate changes. Geographically, the overall change would have been attributable to a decrease in Americas of $17.7 million, a decrease in EMEA of $15.7 million and a decrease in Asia Pacific of $13.7 million. The $37.7 million difference between license revenues recognized under Topic 606 and those proforma Topic 605 license revenues described above is the result of timing differences, where under Topic 605, revenues would have been deferred and recognized over time, but under Topic 606 these revenues are recognized up front.

Aggregate customer care costs, which include billing and service provisioning, are allocated between Cost of services and Selling, general and administrative expense. Cost of services decreased $413 million, or 1.3%, during 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to decreases in network access costs, a product realignment charge in 2018 (see \u201cSpecial Items\u201d), decreases in employee-related costs resulting from the Voluntary Separation Program and decreases in digital content costs. These decreases were partially offset by increases in rent expense as a result of adding capacity to the networks to support demand and the adoption of the new lease accounting standard in 2019, regulatory fees, and costs related to the device protection package offered to our wireless retail postpaid customers. Cost of Wireless Equipment Cost of wireless equipment decreased $369 million, or 1.6%, during 2019 compared to 2018, primarily as a result of declines in the number of wireless devices sold as a result of an elongation of the handset upgrade cycle, partially offset by a shift to higher priced devices in the mix of wireless devices sold. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Selling, general and administrative expense includes salaries and wages and benefits not directly attributable to a service or product, bad debt charges, taxes other than income taxes, advertising and sales commission costs, call center and information technology costs, regulatory fees, professional service fees, and rent and utilities for administrative space.

Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $721 million, or 4.1%, during 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the change in the mix of net depreciable assets.

    "context": "Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Earnings before Interest Expense, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization, adjusted to exclude the impact of Special Items. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as one of many measures to assess the performance of the business. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is the performance metric used by the Company's chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance of our reportable segments. Adjusted EBITDA is also a metric used to determine performance in the Company's Annual Incentive Plan. We do not believe there are estimates underlying the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, other than those inherent in our U.S. GAAP results of operations, which would render the use and presentation of Adjusted EBITDA misleading. While the nature and amount of individual Special Items vary from period to period, we believe our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA is applied consistently to all periods and, in conjunction with other U.S. GAAP and non- U.S. GAAP measures, provides a useful and consistent comparison of our Company's performance to other periods. In our evaluation of Adjusted EBITDA, management assumes that gain/losses related to Special Items may not be reflective of our core operating results. (1) Includes depreciation and amortization adjustments of $(0.8) million and $(2.4) million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. (2) Other Special Items for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, primarily included fees related to professional services, mainly legal fees, directly associated with Special Items or events that are considered one-time or infrequent in nature. The Company may also assess performance using Adjusted EBITDA Margin. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net trade sales. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA Margin is one useful measure to assess the profitability of sales made to third parties and the efficiency of our core operations.

We capitalize incurred labor costs for software development from the time technological feasibility of the software is established, or when the preliminary project phase is completed in the case of internal-use software, until the software is available for general release. Research and development costs and other computer software maintenance costs related to software development are expensed as incurred. We estimate the useful life of our capitalized software and amortize its value over that estimated life. If the actual useful life is shorter than our estimated useful life, we will amortize the remaining book value over the remaining useful life or the asset may be deemed to be impaired and, accordingly, a write-down of the value of the asset may be recorded as a charge to earnings. Upon the availability for general release, we commence amortization of the capitalized software costs on a product by product basis. Amortization of capitalized software is recorded using the greater of (i) the ratio of current revenues to total and anticipated future revenues for the applicable product or (ii) the straightline method over the remaining estimated economic life, which is estimated to be three to five years. At each balance sheet date, the unamortized capitalized costs of a software product are compared with the net realizable value of that product. The net realizable value is the estimated future gross revenues from that product reduced by the estimated future costs of completing and disposing of that product, including the costs of performing maintenance and client support required to satisfy our responsibility set forth at the time of sale. The amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs of a software product exceed the net realizable value of that asset is written off. If we determine that the value of the capitalized software could not be recovered, a write-down of the value of the capitalized software to its recoverable value is recorded as a charge to earnings. The unamortized balances of capitalized software were as follows:\nTable:\n\tDecember 31,\t\n(In thousands)\t2019\t2018\nSoftware development costs\t$428,641\t$317,637\nLess: accumulated amortization\t(184,712)\t(107,977)\nSoftware development costs, net\t$243,929\t$209,660",

Adjusted EBITDA also includes rent paid in the period related to locations that are accounted for as build-to-suit facilities. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides investors and other users of our financial information consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations and facilitates comparisons with our peer companies, many of which use a similar non-GAAP financial measure to supplement their GAAP results. We use Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with traditional GAAP operating performance measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance, and for establishing incentive compensation metrics for executives and other senior employees. We do not place undue reliance on Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of operating performance. This non-GAAP measure should not be considered as a substitute for other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations to using a non-GAAP financial measure, including that other companies may calculate this measure differently than we do, that it does not reflect our capital expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures and that it does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital.

The fair value of each liability is calculated with thousands of projected outcomes, the results of which are averaged and then discounted to estimate the present value. At each reporting date until the respective payment dates, we will remeasure these liabilities, using the same valuation approach based on the applicable subsidiary's revenue and future collection of financed customer receivables, the unobservable inputs, and we will record any changes in the employee's compensation expense. Some of the awards are subject to the employees' continued employment and therefore, recorded on a straight-line basis over the remaining service period. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we settled $0.2 million of the liability related to the subsidiary unit awards. The remaining liability balances are included in either accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities or other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets (see Note 13). The contingent consideration liability consists of the potential earn-out payment related to our acquisition of 85% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OpenEye on October 21, 2019. The earn-out payment is contingent on the satisfaction of certain calendar 2020 revenue targets and has a maximum potential payment of up to $11.0 million. We account for the contingent consideration using fair value and establish a liability for the future earn-out payment based on an estimation of revenue attributable to perpetual licenses and subscription licenses over the 2020 calendar year. We estimated the fair value of the liability by using a Monte Carlo simulation model for determining each of the projected measures by using an expected distribution of potential outcomes. The contingent consideration liability was valued with Level 3 unobservable inputs, including the revenue volatility and the discount rate. At October 21, 2019, the fair value of the liability was $2.8 million. At each reporting date until the payment date in 2021, we will remeasure the liability, using the same valuation approach. Changes in the fair value resulting from information that existed subsequent to the acquisition date are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the contingent consideration liability decreased $0.2 million to $2.6 million as compared to the initial liability recorded at the acquisition date, primarily due to a change to OpenEye's 2020 projected revenue. The unobservable inputs used in the valuation as of December 31, 2019 included a revenue volatility of 45% and a discount rate of 3%. Selecting another revenue volatility or discount rate within an acceptable range would not result in a significant change to the fair value of the contingent consideration liability. The contingent consideration liability is included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 (see Note 13). We monitor the availability of observable market data to assess the appropriate classification of financial instruments within the fair value hierarchy. Changes in economic conditions or model-based valuation techniques may require the transfer of financial instruments from one fair value level to another. In such instances, the transfer is reported at the beginning of the reporting period. There were no transfers between Levels 1, 2 or 3 during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. We also monitor the value of the investments for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. No other-than-temporary impairments occurred during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nTable:\n\tFair Value Measurements Using Significant Unobservable Inputs\t\t\n\tYear Ended December 31, 2019\t\tYear Ended December 31, 2018\n\tSubsidiary Unit Awards\tContingent Consideration Liability from Acquisitions\tSubsidiary Unit Awards\nBeginning of period balance\t385\t$ \u2014\t$3,160\nAcquired liabilities\t\u2014\t2,793\t\u2014\nChanges in fair value included in earnings\t(14)\t(198)\t27\nSettlements\t(200)\t\u2014\t(2,802)\nEnd of period balance\t$171\t$2,595\t$385",

Central Overheads are still expected to be approximately $150 million on an annual basis before taking into account any impact from the Endeavour Group transaction. A small increase in inventory to $4,280 million was primarily due to higher closing inventory in New Zealand and BIG W to improve availability. Closing inventory days declined 0.9 days to 37.2 days and average inventory days from continuing operations declined by 0.2 days to 38.8 days. Net investment in inventory of $939 million remained broadly consistent with prior year. Adjusting for the impact of an extra New Zealand Food payment run in the 53rd week of $153 million, net investment in inventory declined by 19%. Other creditors and provisions of $4,308 million decreased $40 million compared to the prior year. Excluding significant items relating to the BIG W network review and cash utilisation of F16 significant items provisions, the decrease in other creditors and provisions was primarily driven by a reduction in accruals associated with store team costs. Fixed assets, investments and loans to related parties of $9,710 million increased by $528 million. Additions of fixed assets of $2,040 million during the year mainly related to store refurbishments, supply chain and IT infrastructure and included $203 million related to property development activity. This was partially offset by depreciation and amortisation, disposals and an impairment of $166 million associated with the BIG W network review. Net assets held for sale of $225 million decreased by $575 million mainly as a result of the sale of the Petrol business to EG Group on 1 April 2019. Intangible assets of $6,526 million increased by $61 million driven by an increase in goodwill and brand names in New Zealand due to the strengthening of the New Zealand dollar, a minor increase in goodwill associated with the acquisition of businesses partially offset by an impairment to the carrying value of Summergate of $21 million. Net tax balances of $227 million increased $66 million due to an increase in deferred tax assets associated with the provisions raised as a result of the BIG W network review. Net debt of $1,599 million increased by $377 million largely due to the timing of New Zealand creditor payments, higher net capital expenditure (excluding the proceeds from the sale of the Petrol business) and an increase in dividends paid during the year. Normalised Return on Funds Employed (ROFE) from continuing operations was 24.2%, 11 bps up on the prior year. Normalised AASB 16 estimated ROFE was 14.1%. Cash flow from operating activities before interest and tax was $3,858 million, an increase of 0.5% on the prior year. Excluding the impact of significant items, higher EBITDA was offset by the impact of the New Zealand payment run in week 53 and a movement in provisions and accruals. The cash flow benefit from an extra week of trading is offset by nine months of EBITDA from the Petrol business compared to a full year in F18. The cash realisation ratio was 74.1%. Excluding the timing of the New Zealand payment run, and charges associated with the BIG W network review and gain on sale of the Petrol business, the cash realisation ratio was 98.4%, impacted by the cash utilisation of provisions and accruals offset by trade working capital improvements. Net interest paid of $166 million declined by 9.8% compared to the prior year due to the early repayment of US Private Placement Notes in the prior year reducing average borrowing costs.\nTable:\nGroup Profit or Loss\tF19\tF18\t\tCHANGE\nfor the 53 weeks ended 30 June 2019\t53 WEEKS\t52 WEEKS\tCHANGE\tNORMALISED\nMARGINS \u2013 continuing operations\t\t\t\t\nGross profit (%)\t29.1\t29.3\t(24) bps\t(23) bps\nCost of doing business (%)\t24.6\t24.9\t(31) bps\t(30) bps\nEBIT (%)\t4.5\t4.5\t7 bps\t7 bps\nEARNINGS PER SHARE AND DIVIDENDS\t\t\t\t\nWeighted average ordinary shares on issue (million)\t1,305.7\t1,300.5\t0.4%\t\nTotal Group basic EPS (cents) before significant items\t142.8\t132.6\t7.7%\t5.8%\nTotal Group basic EPS (cents) after significant items\t206.2\t132.6\t55.5%\t53.7%\nBasic EPS (cents) \u2013 from continuing operations before significant items\t134.2\t123.4\t8.8%\t6.8%\nBasic EPS (cents) \u2013 from continuing operations after significant items\t114.3\t123.4\t(7.4)%\t(9.3)%\nDiluted EPS (cents) \u2013 from continuing operations before significant items\t133.4\t123.1\t8.4%\t6.4%\nDiluted EPS (cents) \u2013 from continuing operations after significant items\t113.6\t123.1\t(7.7)%\t(9.7)%\nInterim dividend per share (cents)\t45\t43\t4.7%\t\nFinal dividend per share (cents) 1\t57\t50\t14.0%\t\nSpecial dividend per share (cents) 1\t\u2013\t10\tn.m.\t\nTotal dividend per share (cents)\t102\t103\t(1.0)%\t",

Approximately $313 million and $266 million, respectively, would, if recognized, benefit VMware's annual effective income tax rate. VMware includes interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters in the income tax provision.

In addition, VMware is under corporate income tax audits in various states and non-U.S. jurisdictions. Consistent with the Company\u2019s historical practices under the tax sharing agreement with EMC, when VMware becomes subject to federal tax audits as a member of Dell\u2019s consolidated group, the tax sharing agreement provides that Dell has authority to control the audit and represent Dell\u2019s and VMware\u2019s interests to the IRS. Open tax years subject to examinations for larger non-U.S. jurisdictions vary beginning in 2008. Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. When considering the outcomes and the timing of tax examinations, the expiration of statutes of limitations for specific jurisdictions, or the timing and result of ruling requests from taxing authorities, it is reasonably possible that total unrecognized tax benefits could be potentially reduced by approximately $17 million within the next 12 months.\nTable:\n\t\tFor the Year Ended\t\n\tJanuary 31, 2020\tFebruary 1, 2019\tFebruary 2, 2018\nBalance, beginning of the year\t$385\t$305\t$265\nTax positions related to current year:\t\t\t\nAdditions\t116\t57\t63\nTax positions related to prior years:\t\t\t\nAdditions\t98\t44\t2\nReductions\t(7)\t(1)\t(2)\nSettlements\t(28)\t(4)\t(9)\nReductions resulting from a lapse of the statute of limitations\t(83)\t(8)\t(24)\nForeign currency effects\t(2)\t(8)\t10\nBalance, end of the year\t$479\t$385\t$305",

On February 28, 2018 (the \u201cWombat Acquisition Date\u201d), pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the Company acquired all shares of Wombat Security Technologies, Inc. (\u201cWombat\u201d), a leader for phishing simulation and security awareness computer-based training. By collecting data from Wombat\u2019s PhishAlarm solution, the Company has access to data on phishing campaigns as seen by non-Company customers, providing broader visibility and insight to the Proofpoint Nexus platform. With this acquisition, the Company\u2019s customers can leverage the industry\u2019s first solution combining the Company\u2019s advanced threat protection with Wombat\u2019s phishing simulation and computer-based security awareness training. With the combined solutions, the Company\u2019s customers can: use real detected phishing attacks for simulations, assessing users based on the threats that are actually targeting them; both investigate and take action on user-reporting phishing, leveraging orchestration and automation to find real attacks, quarantine emails in users\u2019 inboxes, and lock user accounts to limit risk; and train users in the moment immediately after they click for both simulated and real phishing attacks. The Company also expects to achieve savings in corporate overhead costs for the combined entities. These factors, among others, contributed to a purchase price in excess of the estimated fair value of acquired net identifiable assets and, as a result, goodwill was recorded in connection with the acquisition. Proofpoint, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (dollars and share amounts in thousands, except per share amounts) At the Wombat Acquisition Date, the consideration transferred was $225,366, net of cash acquired of $13,452. Per the terms of the merger agreement, unvested in-the-money stock options held by Wombat employees were canceled and paid off using the same amount per option as for the common share less applicable exercise price for each option. The fair value of $1,580 of these unvested options was attributed to pre-combination service and included in consideration transferred. The fair value of unvested options of $1,571 was allocated to post-combination services and expensed in the three months ended March 31, 2018. Also, as part of the merger agreement, 51 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock were deferred for certain key employees with the total fair value of $5,458 (see Note 11 \u201cEquity Award Plans\u201d), which was not included in the purchase price. The deferred shares are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the lapse of the restrictions, and their fair value is expensed as stock-based compensation expense over the remaining service period.

    "context": "Note 15. Stock-Based Compensation The following table summarizes the components of non-cash stock-based compensation expense (in thousands): 2015 Equity Incentive Plan We issue stock options pursuant to our 2015 Plan. The 2015 Plan allows for the grant of stock options to employees and for the grant of nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, or RSUs, performance-based stock awards, and other forms of equity compensation to our employees, directors and non-employee directors and consultants. In June 2015, our board of directors adopted and our stockholders approved our 2015 Plan pursuant to which we initially reserved a total of 4,700,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the 2015 Plan, which included shares of our common stock previously reserved for issuance under our Amended and Restated 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, or the 2009 Plan. The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2015 Plan will automatically increase on January 1 each year, for a period of not more than ten years, commencing on January 1, 2016 through January 1, 2024, by 5% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year, or a lesser number of shares as may be determined by the board of directors. As a result of the adoption of the 2015 Plan, no further grants may be made under the 2009 Plan. As of December 31, 2019, 6,527,550 shares remained available for future grant under the 2015 Plan. Stock Options Stock options under the 2015 Plan have been granted at exercise prices based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock options under the 2009 Plan were granted at exercise prices as determined by the board of directors to be the fair market value of our common stock. Our stock options generally vest over a five-year period and each option, if not exercised or forfeited, expires on the tenth anniversary of the grant date. Certain stock options granted under the 2015 Plan and previously granted under the 2009 Plan may be exercised before the options have vested. Unvested shares issued as a result of early exercise are subject to repurchase by us upon termination of employment or services at the original exercise price. The proceeds from the early exercise of stock options are initially recorded as a current liability and are reclassified to common stock and additional paid-in capital as the awards vest and our repurchase right lapses. There were 250 and 957 unvested shares of common stock outstanding subject to our right of repurchase as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We repurchased 27 and 107 of these unvested shares of common stock related to early exercised stock options in connection with employee terminations during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We recorded less than $0.1 million in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets for the proceeds from the early exercise of the unvested stock options as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. We account for stock-based compensation options based on the fair value of the award as of the grant date. We recognize stock-based compensation expense using the accelerated attribution method, net of actual forfeitures, in which compensation cost for each vesting tranche in an award is recognized ratably from the service inception date to the vesting date for that tranche. We value our stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the risk-free interest rate, expected term, expected stock price volatility and dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates for constant maturity U.S. Treasury securities consistent with the expected term of our stock options. The expected term represents the period of time the stock options are expected to be outstanding and is based on the \"simplified method.\" Under the \"simplified method,\" the expected term of an option is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. We use the \"simplified method\" due to the lack of sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to otherwise estimate the expected term of the stock options. Beginning in November 2019, the expected volatility for options granted is based on historical volatilities of our stock over the estimated expected term of the stock options. The expected volatility for options granted prior to November 2019 was based on historical volatilities of our stock and publicly traded stock of comparable companies over the estimated expected term of the stock options. There were 186,500, 219,450 and 252,100 stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We declared and paid dividends in June 2015 in anticipation of our IPO, which we closed on July 1, 2015. Subsequent to the IPO, we do not expect to declare or pay dividends on a recurring basis. As such, we assume that the dividend rate is 0%.\nTable:\n\t\tYear Ended December 31,\t\n\t2019\t2018\t2017\nStock options and assumed options\t$3,783\t$3,511\t$3,913\nRestricted stock units\t16,627\t9,770\t3,366\nRestricted stock awards\t\u2014\t1\t19\nEmployee stock purchase plan\t193\t147\t115\nTotal stock-based compensation expense\t$20,603\t$13,429\t$7,413\nTax benefit from stock-based awards\t$5,154\t$7,581\t$12,719",

These rentals are calculated as a percentage of the turnover of the store occupying the premises, with the percentage and turnover threshold at which the additional rentals commence varying with each lease agreement. The Group leases retail premises and warehousing facilities which are generally for periods up to 40 years. The operating lease commitments include leases for the Norwest office and distribution centres. Generally the lease agreements are for initial terms of between five and 25 years and most include multiple renewal options for additional five to 10-year terms. Under most leases, the Group is responsible for property taxes, insurance, maintenance, and expenses related to the leased properties. However, many of the more recent lease agreements have been negotiated on a gross or semi-gross basis, which eliminates or significantly reduces the Group\u2019s exposure to operational charges associated with the properties.

Lease receivables represent sales-type and direct-financing leases resulting from the sale of Cisco\u2019s and complementary third-party products and are typically collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Lease receivables consist of arrangements with terms of four years on average. Loan receivables represent financing arrangements related to the sale of our hardware, software, and services, which may include additional funding for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. Loan receivables have terms of three years on average. Financed service contracts include financing receivables related to technical support and advanced services.

The Directors believe the information additional to IFRS measures included in the report is relevant and useful in measuring the financial performance of the Group. These include: EBITDA, NPATA and EPSa. These measures have been defined in the Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer\u2019s Joint Report on page 2. In 2019 the business continued to deliver strong results after the record 2018 year. Revenues and EBITDA were in line with guidance. Further details on the Group\u2019s results are outlined in the Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer\u2019s Joint Report on page 2. On 1 June 2019, Hansen acquired the Sigma Systems business (Sigma) and one month of these results are included in the FY19 result. Also included in the results are the transaction and other restructuring costs related to the acquisition, which we have identified as separately disclosed items in our results. This acquisition has also resulted in the re-balancing of the Group\u2019s market portfolio which, post the acquisition of Enoro in FY18, was initially weighted towards the Utilities sector. With Sigma\u2019s revenues concentrated in the Communications sector, the Group\u2019s revenue portfolio is now re-balanced to ensure greater diversification across multiple industries, regions and clients. The Group has generated operating cash flows of $39.7 million, which has been used to retire external debt and fund dividends of $12.6 million during the financial year. With the introduction of a higher level of debt in June 2019 to fund the Sigma acquisition, the Group has, for the first time, used the strength of the Group\u2019s balance sheet to fund 100% of an acquisition. With the Group\u2019s strong cash generation, Hansen is well placed to service and retire the debt over the coming years.\nTable:\n\t2019\t2018\t\n\tA$ Million\tA$ Million\tVariance %\nOperating revenue\t231.3\t230.8\t0.2%\nEBITDA1\t53.0\t59.3\t(10.6%)\nNPAT\t21.5\t28.9\t(25.6%)\nNPATA1\t31.2\t38.0\t(17.9%)\nBasic earnings per share (EPS) (cents)\t10.9\t14.8\t(26.4%)\nBasic EPSa1 (cents)\t15.8\t19.4\t(18.6%)",

Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments consisted of the following (in millions): As of April 26, 2019 and April 27, 2018, $3.7 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were held by various foreign subsidiaries and were generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings, while $0.2 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively, were available in the U.S. The TCJA imposes a one-time transition tax on substantially all accumulated foreign earnings through December 31, 2017, and generally allows companies to make distributions of foreign earnings without incurring additional federal taxes. As a part of the recognition of the impacts of the TCJA, we have reviewed our projected global cash requirements and have determined that certain historical and future foreign earnings will no longer be indefinitely reinvested. Our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs, support ongoing business activities, fund research and development, meet capital expenditure needs, invest in critical or complementary technologies, service interest and principal payments on our debt, fund our stock repurchase program, and pay dividends, as and if declared. The principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity. We attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in high-quality investment grade securities, limiting the time to maturity and monitoring the counter-parties and underlying obligors closely. We believe our cash equivalents and short-term investments are liquid and accessible. We are not aware of any significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or investments from the values reported as of April 26, 2019. Our investment portfolio has been and will continue to be exposed to market risk due to trends in the credit and capital markets. We continue to closely monitor current economic and market events to minimize the market risk of our investment portfolio. We routinely monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign borrowers and counterparties. We utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations.

These repurchases can be conducted on the open market or as private purchases and may include the use of derivative contracts with large financial institutions, in all cases subject to compliance with applicable law. This repurchase program has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Funding for this share repurchase program may be through a combination of cash on hand, cash generation, and borrowings. As of June 30, 2019, we have purchased approximately $2.0 billion of shares under this authorization, $0.5 billion via open market trading and $1.5 billion utilizing accelerated share repurchase arrangements. Accelerated Share Repurchase Agreements On June 4, 2019, we entered into four separate accelerated share repurchase agreements (collectively, the \u201cJune 2019 ASR\u201d) with two financial institutions to repurchase a total of $750 million of Common Stock. We took an initial delivery of approximately 3.1 million shares, which represented 75% of the prepayment amount divided by our closing stock price on June 4, 2019. The total number of shares received under the June 2019 ASR will be based upon the average daily volume weighted average price of our Common Stock during the repurchase period, less an agreed upon discount. Final settlement of the June 2019 ASR is anticipated to occur no later than November 20, 2019. On January 31, 2019, we entered into two separate accelerated share repurchase agreements (collectively, the \u201cJanuary 2019 ASR\u201d) with two financial institutions to repurchase a total of $760 million of Common Stock. We took an initial delivery of approximately 3.3 million shares, which represented 75% of the prepayment amount divided by our closing stock price on January 30, 2019. The total number of shares received under the January 2019 ASR was based upon the average daily volume weighted average price of our Common Stock during the repurchase period, less an agreed upon discount. Final settlement of the agreements occurred during May 2019, resulted in the receipt of approximately 0.8 million additional shares, which yielded a weighted-average share price of approximately $182.32 for the transaction period. Share repurchases, including those under the repurchase program, were as follows: (1) During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, we acquired 0.5 million shares at a total cost of $80.5 million which we withheld through net share settlements to cover minimum tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock unit awards granted under our equity compensation plans. The shares retained by us through these net share settlements are not a part of the Board-authorized repurchase program but instead are authorized under our equity compensation plan.

    "context": "Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018 Our management reviews and analyzes several key financial measures in order to manage our business and assess the quality of and variability of our service revenue, operating results and cash flows. The following summary tables present a comparison of our results of operations with respect to certain key financial measures. The comparisons illustrated in the tables are discussed in greater detail below. (1) Includes non-cash equity-based compensation expense of $994 and $895 for 2019 and 2018, respectively. (2) Includes non-cash equity-based compensation expense of $17,466 and $16,813 for 2019 and 2018, respectively. Service Revenue. Our service revenue increased 5.0% from 2018 to 2019. Exchange rates negatively impacted our increase in service revenue by approximately $5.3 million. All foreign currency comparisons herein reflect results for 2019 translated at the average foreign currency exchange rates for 2018. We increased our total service revenue by increasing the number of sales representatives selling our services, by expanding our network, by adding additional buildings to our network, by increasing our penetration into the buildings connected to our network and by gaining market share by offering our services at lower prices than our competitors. Revenue recognition standards include guidance relating to any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include, but is not limited to, gross receipts taxes, Universal Service Fund fees and certain state regulatory fees. We record these taxes billed to our customers on a gross basis (as service revenue and network operations expense) in our consolidated statements of operations. The impact of these taxes including the Universal Service Fund resulted in an increase to our revenues from 2018 to 2019 of approximately $2.4 million. Our net-centric customers tend to purchase their service on a price per megabit basis. Our corporate customers tend to utilize a small portion of their allocated bandwidth on their connections and tend to purchase their service on a per connection basis. Revenues from our corporate and net-centric customers represented 68.4% and 31.6% of total service revenue, respectively, for 2019 and represented 64.9% and 35.1% of total service revenue, respectively, for 2018. Revenues from corporate customers increased 10.6% to $373.7 million for 2019 from $337.8 million for 2018 primarily due to an increase in our number of our corporate customers. Revenues from our net-centric customers decreased by 5.4% to $172.5 million for 2019 from $182.3 million for 2018 primarily due to an increase in our number of net-centric customers being offset by a decline in our average price per megabit. Our revenue from our net-centric customers has declined as a percentage of our total revenue and grew at a slower rate than our corporate customer revenue because net-centric customers purchase our services based upon a price per megabit basis and our average price per megabit declined by 23.9% from 2018 to 2019. Additionally, the net-centric market experiences a greater level of pricing pressure than the corporate market and net-centric customers who renew their service with us expect their renewed service to be at a lower price than their current price. We expect that our average price per megabit will continue to decline at similar rates which would result in our corporate revenues continuing to represent a greater portion of our total revenues and our net-centric revenues continuing to grow at a lower rate than our corporate revenues. Additionally, the impact of foreign exchange rates has a more significant impact on our net-centric revenues. Our on-net revenues increased 5.9% from 2018 to 2019. We increased the number of our on-net customer connections by 8.4% at December 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018. On-net customer connections increased at a greater rate than on-net revenues primarily due to the 3.8% decline in our on-net ARPU, primarily from a decline in ARPU for our net-centric customers. ARPU is determined by dividing revenue for the period by the average customer connections for that period. Our average price per megabit for our installed base of customers is determined by dividing the aggregate monthly recurring fixed charges for those customers by the aggregate committed data rate for the same customers. The decline in on-net ARPU is partly attributed to volume and term based pricing discounts. Additionally, on-net customers who cancel their service from our installed base of customers, in general, have an ARPU that is greater than the ARPU for our new customers due to declining prices primarily for our on-net services sold to our net-centric customers. These trends resulted in the reduction to our on-net ARPU and a 23.9% decline in our average price per megabit for our installed base of customers. Our off-net revenues increased 2.7% from 2018 to 2019. Our off-net revenues increased as we increased the number of our off-net customer connections by 6.3% at December 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018. Our off-net customer connections increased at a greater rate than our off-net revenue primarily due to the 5.0% decrease in our off-net ARPU. Network Operations Expenses. Network operations expenses include the costs of personnel associated with service delivery, network management, and customer support, network facilities costs, fiber and equipment maintenance fees, leased circuit costs, access and facilities fees paid to building owners and excise taxes billed to our customers and recorded on a gross basis. Non-cash equity-based compensation expense is included in network operations expenses consistent with the classification of the employee's salary and other compensation. Our network operations expenses, including non-cash equity-based compensation expense, increased 0.1% from 2018 to 2019 as we were connected to 8.0% more customer connections and we were connected to 125 more on-net buildings as of December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018. The increase in network operations expense is primarily attributable to an increase in costs related to our network and facilities expansion activities, the increase in our off-net revenues and the increase in taxes recorded on a gross basis partly offset by price reductions obtained in certain of our circuit costs and fewer fiber operating leases. When we provide off-net services we also assume the cost of the associated tail circuits. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses (\u201cSG&A\u201d). Our SG&A expenses, including non-cash equity- based compensation expense, increased 9.8% from 2018 to 2019. Non-cash equity-based compensation expense is included in SG&A expenses consistent with the classification of the employee's salary and other compensation and was $17.5 million for 2019 and $16.8 million for 2018. SG&A expenses increased primarily from an increase in salaries and related costs required to support our expansion and increases in our sales efforts and an increase in our headcount. Our sales force headcount increased by 10.8% from 619 at December 31, 2018 to 686 at December 31, 2019 and our total headcount increased by 8.3% from 974 at December 31, 2018 to 1,055 at December 31, 2019. Depreciation and Amortization Expenses. Our depreciation and amortization expenses decreased 1.2% from 2018 to 2019. The decrease is primarily due to the depreciation expense associated with the increase related to newly deployed fixed assets being offset by the decline in depreciation expense from fully depreciated fixed assets. Gains on Equipment Transactions. We exchanged certain used network equipment and cash consideration for new network equipment resulting in gains of $1.1 million for 2019 and $1.0 million for 2018. The gains are based upon the excess of the estimated fair value of the new network equipment over the carrying amount of the returned used network equipment and the cash paid. The increase in gains from 2018 to 2019 was due to purchasing more equipment under the exchange program in 2019 than we purchased in 2018. Interest Expense. Interest expense results from interest incurred on our $445.0 million of senior secured notes, interest incurred on our $189.2 million of senior unsecured notes, interest on our installment payment agreement, interest on our finance lease obligations and interest incurred on our \u20ac135.0 million of 2024 Notes that we issued on June 25, 2019. Our interest expense increased by 12.5% for 2019 from 2018 primarily due to the issuance of $70.0 million of senior secured notes we issued in August 2018, the issuance of \u20ac135.0 million of senior unsecured notes we issued in June 2019 and an increase in our finance lease obligations. The 2024 Notes were issued at par for \u20ac135.0 million ($153.7 million) on June 25, 2019. The 2024 Notes were issued in Euros and are reported in our reporting currency \u2014 US Dollars. As of December 31, 2019 the 2024 Notes were valued at $151.4 million resulting in an unrealized gain on foreign exchange of $2.3 million in 2019. Income Tax Expense. Our income tax expense was $15.1 million for 2019 and $12.7 million for 2018. The increase in our income tax expense was primarily related to an increase in our income before income taxes. Buildings On-net. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 we had a total of 2,801 and 2,676 on-net buildings connected to our network, respectively.\nTable:\n\tYear Ended December 31\tPercent Change\t\n\t2019\t2018\tChange\n\t(in thousands)\t\t\nService revenue\t$546,159\t$520,193\t5.0%\nOn-net revenues\t396,753\t374,555\t5.9%\nOff-net revenues\t148,931\t145,004\t2.7%\nNetwork operations expenses(1)\t219,801\t219,526\t0.1%\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses(2)\t146,913\t133,858\t9.8%\nDepreciation and amortization expenses\t80,247\t81,233\t(1.2)%\nGains on equipment transactions\t1,059\t982\t7.8%\nInterest expense\t57,453\t51,056\t12.5%\nIncome tax expense\t15,154\t12,715\t19.2%",

    "context": "Note 6 Segments The Company\u2019s segment reporting structure consists of two reportable segments and a Corporate category as follows: \u2022 Food Care; and \u2022 Product Care. The Company\u2019s Food Care and Product Care segments are considered reportable segments under FASB ASC Topic 280. Our reportable segments are aligned with similar groups of products. Corporate includes certain costs that are not allocated to or monitored by the reportable segments' management. The Company evaluates performance of the reportable segments based on the results of each segment. The performance metric used by the Company's chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance of our reportable segments is Adjusted EBITDA. The Company allocates expense to each segment based on various factors including direct usage of resources, allocation of headcount, allocation of software licenses or, in cases where costs are not clearly delineated, costs may be allocated on portion of either net trade sales or an expense factor such as cost of goods sold. We allocate and disclose depreciation and amortization expense to our segments, although depreciation and amortization are not included in the segment performance metric Adjusted EBITDA. We also allocate and disclose restructuring charges and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets by segment. However, restructuring charges and goodwill are not included in the segment performance metric Adjusted EBITDA since they are categorized as certain specified items (\u201cSpecial Items\u201d), in addition to certain transaction and other charges and gains related to acquisitions and divestitures and certain other specific items excluded from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA.

Selling, general and administrative expense includes personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, amortization of certain acquired intangible assets, third-party sales commissions, field application engineering support, travel costs, professional and consulting fees, legal fees, depreciation expense and allocated occupancy costs. Impairment Losses. Impairment losses consist of charges resulting from the impairment of acquired intangible assets. Restructuring Charges. Restructuring charges consist of severance, lease and leasehold impairment charges, and other charges related to restructuring plans. Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net. Interest and other income (expense), net includes interest income, interest expense and other income (expense). Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balances. Interest expense consists of interest accrued on debt. Other income (expense) generally consists of income (expense) generated from non-operating transactions. Income Tax Provision (Benefit). We make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expenses for tax and financial statement purposes and the realizability of assets in future years.

Segment Information The Company operates under two reportable segments based on the geographic locations of its subsidiaries: (1) \u00a0FEI-NY \u2013 operates out of New York and its operations consist principally of precision time and frequency control products used in three principal markets- communication satellites (both commercial and U.S. Government-funded); terrestrial cellular telephone or other ground-based telecommunication stations; and other components and systems for the U.S. military. The FEI-NY segment also includes the operations of the Company\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiaries, FEI-Elcom and FEI-Asia. FEI- Asia functions as a manufacturing facility for the FEI-NY segment with historically minimal sales to outside customers. FEI- Elcom, in addition to its own product line, provides design and technical support for the FEI-NY segment\u2019s satellite business. (2) \u00a0FEI-Zyfer \u2013 operates out of California and its products incorporate Global Positioning System (GPS) technologies into systems and subsystems for secure communications, both government and commercial, and other locator applications. This segment also provides sales and support for the Company\u2019s wireline telecommunications family of products, including US5G, which are sold in the U. S. market. The Company measures segment performance based on total revenues and profits generated by each geographic location rather than on the specific types of customers or end-users. Consequently, the Company determined that the segments indicated above most appropriately reflect the way the Company\u2019s management views the business. The accounting policies of the two segments are the same as those described in the \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d The Company evaluates the performance of its segments and allocates resources to them based on operating profit which is defined as income before investment income, interest expense and taxes. All acquired assets, including intangible assets, are included in the assets of both reporting segments.

There was strong growth in Cloud & Data Platforms, as reported and at constant currency, driven primarily by the acquisition of Red Hat in the third quarter of 2019. Red Hat had continued strong performance since the acquisition, in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), application development and emerging technologies, led by OpenShift and Ansible. Red Hat and IBM are driving synergies with strong adoption of Cloud Paks since their introduction, expansion of our combined client base and more than 2,000 clients using our hybrid cloud platform. Cognitive Applications also grew as reported and at constant currency. Transaction Processing Platforms declined year to year as reported, but grew 1 percent adjusted for currency driven by strong fourth-quarter performance. Cognitive Applications revenue of $5,765 million grew 2.3 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year, driven by double-digit growth as reported and adjusted for currency in Security, and growth in industry verticals such as IoT. The Security performance included continued strong results in threat management software and services offerings. Within IoT, we had good revenue performance across the portfolio as we continued to invest in new offerings and industry-specific solutions. Cloud & Data Platforms revenue of $9,499 million increased 10.4 percent as reported (12 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year.

These estimates are adjusted to actual percentages experienced at each reporting date. As such, the Group determines its revenue by estimating variable consideration and applying the constraint by utilising industry data and historical experience (refer to note 3.6 for further information). Key estimate: trail commission revenue The method of revenue recognition for trail commission revenue requires Directors and management to make certain estimates and assumptions based on industry data and historical experience of the Group. Refer to note 3.4 for details on trail commission revenue. Recognition and measurement Revenue represents the variable consideration estimated at the point in time when the Group has essentially completed its contracted services and constrained until it is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the associated uncertainty with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Upfront fees When the Group refers a consumer to the product provider (and thereby satisfies its performance obligation), the Group is entitled to an upfront fee that is contingent upon the following events: (a) the referred sale becoming \u2018financial\u2019, which occurs upon new members joining a health fund, initiating a life insurance policy, obtaining general insurance products, mortgages, broadband or energy products via iSelect; and (b) whether a \u2018clawback\u2019 of the upfront fee is triggered. Upfront fees may trigger a \u2018clawback\u2019 of revenue in the event of early termination by customers as specified in individual product provider agreements. These contingencies are incorporated into the estimate of variable consideration (refer to key estimates). Click-through fees Click-through fees are recognised based on the contractual arrangement with the relevant product provider. This can occur at one of three points; either when an internet user clicks on a paying advertiser\u2019s link, submits an application or a submitted application is approved. Advertising and subscription fees Revenue for contracted services, including advertising and subscription fees, are recognised based on the transaction price allocated to each key performance obligation. As a result, non-refundable revenue may be recognised across multiple periods until the performance obligation has been satisfied. Trail commission revenue Trail commissions are ongoing fees for customers referred to individual product providers or who have applied for mortgages via iSelect. Trail commission revenue represents commission earned calculated as a percentage of the value of the underlying policy relationship to the expected life and, in the case of mortgages, a proportion of the underlying value of the loan. The Group is entitled to receive trail commission without having to perform further services. On initial recognition, trail revenue and assets are recognised at expected value and subject to constraints.\nTable:\n\tCONSOLIDATED\t\n\t2019 $'000\t2018 $'000\nUpfront revenue\t\t\nUpfront fees\t113,609\t140,971\nClick-through fees\t3,657\t1,349\nAdvertising and subscription fees\t2,161\t1,604\n\t119,427\t143,924\nTrail commission revenue\t34,732\t33,007\nTotal revenue from contracts with customers\t154,159\t176,931\nRevenue related to performance obligations satisfied in previous years\t502\t4,760",

    "context": "Share Unit Awards In accordance with stockholder-approved equity incentive plans, we grant awards of restricted stock units and cash-settled restricted stock units (\"share units\") to employees and directors. These awards generally have requisite service periods of three years. Under each such award, stock or cash (as applicable) is issued without direct cost to the employee. We estimate the fair value of the share units based upon the market price of our stock at the date of grant. Certain share unit grants do not provide for the payment of dividend equivalents to the participant during the requisite service period (the \"vesting period\"). For those grants, the value of the grants is reduced by the net present value of the foregone dividend equivalent payments. We recognize compensation expense for share unit awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, accounting for forfeitures as they occur. All cash-settled restricted stock units are marked-to-market and presented within other current and noncurrent liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The compensation expense for our stock-settled share unit awards totaled $23.9 million, $21.8 million, and $18.2 million for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, including discontinued operations of $1.4 million for fiscal 2017. The tax benefit related to the stock-settled share unit award compensation expense for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $6.0 million, $7.2 million, and $7.0 million, respectively. The compensation expense for our cash-settled share unit awards totaled $17.5 million, $5.8 million, and $20.9 million for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, including discontinued operations of $2.6 million for fiscal 2017. The tax benefit related to the cash-settled share unit award compensation expense for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $4.4 million, $1.9 million, and $8.0 million, respectively. During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, in connection with the completion of the Pinnacle acquisition, we granted 2.0 million cash-settled share unit awards at a grant date fair value of $36.37 per share unit to Pinnacle employees in replacement of their unvested restricted share unit awards that were outstanding as of the closing date. Included in the compensation expense described above for fiscal 2019 is expense of $18.9 million for accelerated vesting of awards related to Pinnacle integration restructuring activities, net of the impact of marking-to-market these awards based on a lower market price of shares of Conagra Brands common stock. Approximately $36.3 million of the fair value of the replacement share unit awards granted to Pinnacle employees was attributable to pre-combination service and was included in the purchase price and established as a liability. Included in the expense for cash-settled share unit awards above is income of $6.7 million related to the mark-to-market of this liability. As of May 26, 2019, our liability for the replacement awards was $15.9 million, which includes post-combination service expense, the mark-to-market of the liability, and the impact of payouts since completing the Pinnacle acquisition. Post-combination expense of approximately $3.9 million, based on the market price of shares of Conagra Brands common stock as of May 26, 2019, is expected to be recognized related to the replacement awards over the remaining post-combination service period of approximately two years. The following table summarizes the nonvested share units as of May 26, 2019 and changes during the fiscal year then ended: During fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, we granted 0.9 million, 0.9 million, and 0.6 million stock-settled share units, respectively, with a weighted average grant date fair value of $35.43, $34.16, and $46.79 per share unit, respectively. During fiscal 2017, we granted 0.4 million cash-settled share units with a weighted average grant date fair value of $48.07 per share unit. No cash-settled share unit awards were granted in fiscal 2018. The total intrinsic value of stock-settled share units vested was $24.6 million, $18.5 million, and $27.0 million during fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The total intrinsic value of cash-settled share units vested was $50.5 million, $14.2 million, and $24.0 million during fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.

The projected cash flows were updated to reflect a change in Senior Management and their initial views as part of a strategic review undertaken. The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections was 13% (30 June 2018: 25%) and cash flows beyond the five-year period were extrapolated using a 3% growth rate (30 June 2018: 3%). As a result of this analysis, management recognised an impairment charge of $4,450,000 against goodwill and capitalised software development costs. No other impairment was identified for the CGUs to which goodwill or brand names are allocated. 3.2 Goodwill and other intangible assets (continued) Key estimates \u2013 value-in-use calculation Cash flow projections Our cash flow projections are based on five-year management-approved forecasts unless a longer period is justified. The forecasts use management estimates to determine income, expenses, capital expenditure and cash flows for each asset and CGU. Discount rate Discount rates represent the current market assessment of the risks specific to each CGU, taking into consideration the time value of money and individual risks of the underlying assets that have not been incorporated in the cash flow estimates. The discount rate calculation is based on the specific circumstances of the Group and its operating segments and is derived from its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The WACC takes into account both debt and equity. The cost of equity is derived from the expected return on investment by the Group\u2019s investors. The cost of debt is based on the interest bearing borrowings the Group is obliged to service. CGU-specific risk is incorporated into the WACC rate where it is considered appropriate. The pre-tax discount rates are as follows: 1 Discount rate based on impairment assessment completed on 31 December 2018 which resulted in full impairment of goodwill allocated to Home Loans CGU 2 Money CGU which consisted of the Infochoice business was sold to an independent third party on 18 February 2019. Refer to note 6.3 for details. Growth rate estimates For each CGU (excluding International), 5 years of cash flows have been included in the cash flow models. These are based on the long-term plan and growth rates of 3%. Market share assumptions These assumptions are important because management assesses how the unit\u2019s position, relative to its competitors, might change over the budget period. Management expects the Group\u2019s share of its respective markets to grow over the forecast period. Sensitivity to changes in assumptions With regard to the assessment of \u2018value-in-use\u2019 of the CGUs, management believes that no reasonable change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the units to materially exceed its recoverable amount.\nTable:\nCGU\tFY19\tFY18\nHealth\t11.1%\t11.6%\nCar\t12.7%\t11.6%\nHome Loans\t13.0%1\t25.4%\nMoney\tn/a2\t11.0%\nLife\t11.3%\t12.7%\nHousehold\t10.5%\t12.2%\nInternational\t11.0%\tn.a.",

Under the Plan, eligible participants may be granted performance rights on terms and conditions determined by the Board from time to time. Performance rights were granted during the course of FY17, FY18 and FY19. The vesting conditions for grants relate to TSR exceeding the ASX 200 Accumulation Index over the measurement period. Vesting of the rights will be tested on or around the day following the release of each of the annual results for the years ended 30 June 2019, 2020 and 2021 respectively. Performance rights are granted by the Company for nil consideration. The Board has discretion to determine if the value will be provided in shares, cash or a combination of shares and cash. Rights granted under the plan carry no dividend or voting rights.

The fair value measurement should reflect all the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. A fair value hierarchy is established in the authoritative guidance outlined in three levels ranking from Level 1 to level 3 with Level 1 being the highest priority. Level 1: observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly Level 3: unobservable inputs (e.g., a reporting entity\u2019s or other entity\u2019s own data) The Company had no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring (except our pension plan assets, see Note 15) or\nnon-recurring basis as of September 30, 2019 or September 30, 2018. To estimate fair value of the financial instruments below quoted market prices are used when available and classified within Level 1. If this data is not available, we use observable market based inputs to estimate fair value, which are classified within Level 2. If the preceding information is unavailable, we use internally generated data to estimate fair value which is classified within Level 3.

Adjusted EBITDA represents our net loss before interest and investment income, net and interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, loss on extinguishment of convertible notes and stock-based compensation expense. We do not consider these items to be indicative of our core operating performance. The items that are non-cash include depreciation and amortization expense and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA is a measure used by management to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to generate future operating plans, make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and invest in initiatives that are focused on cultivating new markets for our solutions. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating adjusted EBITDA facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Nevertheless, use of adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (1) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the capitalized software that is amortized will need to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; (2) adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (3) adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; (4) adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments or receipts that may represent a reduction or increase in cash\navailable to us; and (5) other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures\ndifferently, which reduces the usefulness of the metric as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA alongside our other GAAP-based financial performance measures, net loss and our other GAAP financial results.

Orders related to external customers were clearly up year-overyear on growth in nearly all industrial businesses, led by Mobility. Gas and Power, Siemens Healthineers, Smart Infrastructure and SGRE all posted clear growth, while orders declined slightly in Digital Industries. Volume from large orders for Industrial Businesses overall was up substantially due to a sharp increase at Mobility, but also due to a significant increase in SGRE and Gas and Power. Growth in emerging markets was driven by orders from China, and from Russia where Mobility won a \u20ac 1.2 billion contract for high-speed trains including maintenance. Order development was mixed in the Europe, C. I. S., Africa, Middle East region. The majority of industrial businesses posted order growth, led by double-digit growth in Mobility, which won several large contracts in the year under review. This increase was more than offset by a substantial decline in SGRE due mainly to a lower volume from large orders and a decrease in Digital Industries. In contrast to the region overall, orders were up clearly in Germany, driven by sharp growth in Gas and Power which recorded, among others, a large high voltage direct current (HVDC) order. Mobility recorded a significant increase in order intake in Germany, while the other industrial businesses posted declines. Orders in the Americas region were up significantly year-over-year, benefiting from positive currency translation effects. Double-digit growth in nearly all industrial businesses was led by SGRE and Mobility with particularly sharp increases. The pattern of order development in the U. S. was largely the same as in the Americas region. In the Asia, Australia region, orders also rose significantly due to growth in nearly all industrial businesses. The primary growth driver was SGRE, which recorded a sharply higher volume from large orders, including two large orders for offshore wind-farms\nincluding service in Taiwan totaling \u20ac 2.3 billion.

The increase was attributable to an increase of $57.7 million caused by movements in working capital accounts due primarily to (a) increased cash from related parties of $56.3 million (mainly collection of Cool Pool receivables), (b) an increase of $20.3 million from movements in other payables and accruals, and (c) an increase of $4.6 million from movements in trade and other receivables, partially offset by an increase in cash collateral on swaps of $22.2 million, an increase of $28.2 million in total revenues (revenues and net pool allocation), partially offset by a decrease of $29.9 million in cash paid for interest including the interest paid for finance leases and a net decrease of $22.3 million from the remaining movements. Net Cash Used In Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $250.0 million, from $693.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 to $443.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is attributable to a decrease of $203.7 million in net cash used in payments for the construction costs of newbuildings and other fixed assets, a net increase of $45.5 million in cash from short-term investments in the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period of 2018 and an increase of $0.8 million in cash from interest income. Net Cash Provided By Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities decreased by $318.0 million, from $368.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 to $50.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is mainly attributable to an increase of $316.0 million in bank loan repayments, a decrease of $208.4 million in proceeds from the GasLog Partners\u2019 issuance of preference units, a decrease of $60.4 million in proceeds from the GasLog Partners\u2019 common unit offerings, an increase of $46.7 million in payments for NOK bond repurchase at a premium, an increase of $26.6 million in cash used for purchases of treasury shares or common units of GasLog Partners, an increase of $18.5 million in payments of loan issuance costs, an increase of $15.4 million in dividend payments on common and preference shares, an increase of $3.7 million in payments for cross currency swaps\u2019 termination, an increase of $2.6 million in payments for lease liabilities, an increase of $0.8 million in payments for equity-related costs and a decrease of $0.5 million in proceeds from stock option exercise, partially offset by an increase of $381.6 million in proceeds from borrowings.\nTable:\n\t\tYear ended December 31,\t\n\t2018\t2019\tChange\nAmounts in thousands of U.S. dollars\t\t\t\nNet cash provided by operating activities\t$283,710\t$317,423\t$33,713\nNet cash used in investing activities\t(692,999)\t(442,978)\t250,021\nNet cash provided by financing activities\t368,120\t50,066\t(318,054)",

The 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the \u201c2007 Plan\u201d), provides for the grant of non-qualified and incentive stock options, as well as restricted stock units, restricted stock and other stock-based awards. Exercise prices for non-qualified and incentive stock options are not less than the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Equity awards typically vest ratably, generally over four years for RSUs and stock options and three years for PSUs. Stock options generally expire 10 years from the date of grant. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had the ability to grant stock-based awards with respect to an aggregate of 7.0 million shares of common stock under the 2007 Plan. In addition, the Company maintains an employee stock purchase plan (the \u201cESPP\u201d) pursuant to which eligible employees may purchase shares of the Company\u2019s common stock on the last day of each bi-annual offering period at a 15% discount from the lower of the closing market value on the first or last day of such offering period.

We have not provided for any repatriation taxes and currently have the intent to leave such cash and cash equivalents in the foreign countries. Cash and cash equivalents increased from $18.0 million as of December 31, 2018 primarily as a result of cash provided by operating activities, offset partially by cash used for repurchases of our common stock and our equity investment in WeekenGO.

Accounts receivable increased $2.6 million to $97.9 million at December 28, 2019 compared to $95.3 million at December 29, 2018 as a result of strong collections despite increased revenues and changes in payment terms related to customer mix.

Variations of each services are also explained as follows: INTERNET Fiscal 2019 Internet service customers net additions stood at 5,966 compared to 14,173 for the prior year mainly due to: \u2022 the ongoing interest in high speed offerings; \u2022 the sustained interest in bundle offers; and \u2022 the increased demand from Internet resellers; partly offset by \u2022 competitive offers in the industry; and \u2022 contact center congestion during the stabilization period of the new customer management system. VIDEO Fiscal 2019 video service customers net losses stood at 39,185 compared to 37,035 for the prior year as a result of: \u2022 highly competitive offers in the industry; \u2022 a changing video consumption environment; and \u2022 contact center congestion during the stabilization period of the new customer management system; partly offset by \u2022 customers' ongoing interest in digital advanced video services; and \u2022 customers' interest in video services bundled with fast Internet offerings. TELEPHONY Fiscal 2019 telephony service customers net losses amounted to 23,333 compared to 32,987 for the prior year mainly due to: \u2022 technical issues with telephony activations following the implementation of the new customer management system which were resolved at the end of the first quarter; \u2022 increasing wireless penetration in North America and various unlimited offers launched by wireless operators causing some customers to cancel their landline telephony services for wireless telephony services only; partly offset by \u2022 growth in the business sector; and \u2022 more telephony bundles due to additional promotional activity in the second half of fiscal 2019.

The majority of the Level 1 assets listed above include the common stock of both U.S. and international companies, mutual funds, master limited partnership units, and real estate investment trusts, all of which are actively traded and priced in the market. Level 2 assets are valued based on other significant observable inputs including quoted prices for similar securities, yield curves, indices, etc. Level 2 assets consist primarily of individual fixed income securities where values are based on quoted prices of similar securities and observable market data. Level 3 assets consist of investments where active market pricing is not readily available and, as such, fair value is estimated using significant unobservable inputs. Certain assets that are measured at fair value using the NAV (net asset value) per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. Such investments are generally considered long-term in nature with varying redemption availability. For certain of these investments, with a fair value of approximately $51.0 million as of May 26, 2019, the asset managers have the ability to impose customary redemption gates which may further restrict or limit the redemption of invested funds therein.

Based on the fair market values of the failed-sale-leaseback assets, the failed-sale-leaseback accounting treatment resulted in a loss of $102 million as a result of the requirement to treat a certain amount of the pre-tax cash proceeds from the sale of the assets as though it were the result of a financing obligation. The combined net loss of $82 million was included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017.

The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed herein do not have standard meaning and may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies or how we may calculate those measures in other instances from time to time. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Also, our \u201ccore\u201d financial measures should not be construed as an inference by us that our future results will be unaffected by those items that are excluded from our \u201ccore\u201d financial measures.

Among other uses, management uses non-GAAP \u201ccore\u201d financial measures to make operating decisions, assess business performance and as a factor in determining certain employee performance when evaluating incentive compensation. We determine the tax effect of the items excluded from \u201ccore\u201d earnings and \u201ccore\u201d diluted earnings per share based upon evaluation of the statutory tax treatment and the applicable tax rate of the jurisdiction in which the pre-tax items were incurred, and for which realization of the resulting tax benefit, if any, is expected. In certain jurisdictions where we do not expect to realize a tax benefit (due to existing tax incentives or a history of operating losses or other factors resulting in a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets), a reduced or 0% tax rate is applied. We are reporting \u201ccore\u201d operating income, \u201ccore\u201d earnings and \u201ccore\u201d return on invested capital to provide investors with an additional method for assessing operating income and earnings, by presenting what we believe are our \u201ccore\u201d manufacturing operations. A significant portion (based on the respective values) of the items that are excluded for purposes of calculating \u201ccore\u201d operating income and \u201ccore\u201d earnings also impacted certain balance sheet assets, resulting in a portion of an asset being written off without a corresponding recovery of cash we may have previously spent with respect to the asset. In the case of restructuring and related charges, we may make associated cash payments in the future. In addition, although, for purposes of calculating \u201ccore\u201d operating income and \u201ccore\u201d earnings, we exclude stock-based compensation expense (which we anticipate continuing to incur in the future) because it is a non-cash expense, the associated stock issued may result in an increase in our outstanding shares of stock, which may result in the dilution of our stockholders\u2019 ownership interest. We encourage you to consider these matters when evaluating the utility of these non-GAAP financial measures. Included in the tables below are a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures as provided in our Consolidated Financial Statements: Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP Financial Results to Non-GAAP Measures (1) Charges during fiscal years 2019 and 2018 relate to inventory and other assets charges for certain distressed customers in the networking and consumer wearables sectors.

At January 31, 2019, the number of restricted stock units granted but\nunvested was 3.9 million. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019, Autodesk granted 0.2 million performance stock units for which the ultimate number of shares earned is determined based on the achievement of performance criteria at the end of the stated service and performance period. The performance criteria for the performance stock units are based on Annualized Recurring Revenue (\"ARR\") and free cash flow per share goals adopted by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee, as well as total stockholder return compared against companies in the S&P Computer Software Select Index or the S&P North American Technology Software Index (\"Relative TSR\"). These performance stock units vest over a three-year period and have the following vesting schedule: Up to one third of the performance stock units may vest following year one, depending upon the achievement of the performance criteria for fiscal 2019 as well as 1-year Relative TSR (covering year one). Up to one third of the performance stock units may vest following year two, depending upon the achievement of the performance criteria for year two as well as 2-year Relative TSR (covering years one and two). Up to one third of the performance stock units may vest following year three, depending upon the achievement of the performance criteria for year three as well as 3-year Relative TSR (covering years one, two and three). Performance stock units are not considered outstanding stock at the time of grant, as the holders of these units are not entitled to any of the rights of a stockholder, including voting rights. Autodesk has determined the grant-date fair value for these awards using the stock price on the date of grant or if the awards are subject to a market condition, a Monte Carlo simulation model. The fair value of the performance stock units is expensed using the accelerated attribution over the vesting period. Autodesk recorded stock-based compensation expense related to performance stock units of $28.6 million, $33.7 million, and $22.9 million during fiscal years ended January 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively. As of January 31, 2019, total compensation cost not yet recognized of $5.6 million related to unvested performance stock units, is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 0.81 years.

The FASB issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance in August 2015, March 2016, April 2016, May 2016 and December 2016 within ASU 2015\u201314, ASU 2016\u201308, ASU 2016\u201310, ASU 2016\u201312 and ASU 2016\u201320, respectively; all of which in combination with ASU 2014-09 were codified as Accounting Standard Codification Topic 606 (\u201cASC 606\u201d). The core principle of the standard is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. The Company adopted ASC 606 on the first day of the current fiscal year, June 25, 2018, under the modified retrospective approach, applying the amendments to prospective reporting periods. Results for reporting periods beginning on or after June 25, 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the historic accounting under ASC 605. In connection with the adoption of ASC 606, the Company\u2019s revenue recognition policy has been amended, refer to Note 2\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for a description of the policy.

Pension plans covering salaried employees provide pension benefits that are based on the employees\u00b4 years of service and compensation prior to retirement. Pension plans covering hourly employees generally provide benefits of stated amounts for each year of service. We also provide post-retirement life insurance benefits for certain retired employees. Domestic employees who were hired prior to 1982 and certain former union employees are eligible for life insurance benefits upon retirement. We fund life insurance benefits through term life insurance policies and intend to continue funding all of the premiums on a pay-as-you-go basis. We recognize the funded status of a benefit plan in our consolidated balance sheets. The funded status is measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation. We also recognize, as a component of other comprehensive earnings, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit/cost. The measurement dates for the pension plans for our U.S. and non-U.S. locations were December 31, 2019, and 2018. During 2017, we offered certain former vested employees in our U.S. pension plan a one-time option to receive a lump sum distribution of their benefits from pension plan assets. The pension plan made approximately $23,912 in lump sum payments to settle its obligation to these participants. These settlement payments decreased the projected benefit obligation and plan assets by $23,912, and resulted in a non-cash settlement charge of $13,476 related to unrecognized net actuarial losses that were previously included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The measurement date of this settlement was December 31, 2017. In February 2020, the CTS Board of Directors authorized and empowered management to explore termination of our U.S. based pension plans at management's discretion, subject to certain conditions.

Farm\nproduction costs are those costs incurred at the egg production facility, including feed, facility, hen amortization, and\nother related farm production costs. The following table presents the key variables affecting our cost of sales: Cost of sales for the fiscal year ended June 1, 2019 was $1,138.3 million, a decrease of $3.6 million, or 0.3%, compared to $1,141.9 million for fiscal 2018. Comparing fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2018, average cost per dozen purchased from outside shell egg producers decreased while cost of feed ingredients and dozens produced increased. For the 2019 fiscal year we produced 84.4% of the eggs sold by us, as compared to 84.2% for the previous year. Feed cost for fiscal 2019 was $0.415 per dozen, compared to $0.394 per dozen for the prior fiscal year, an increase of 5.3%. The increase in feed costs was primarily related to less favorable crop conditions in the south central U. S., which resulted in higher ingredient prices at some of our larger feed mill operations. The increase in feed cost per dozen resulted in an increase in cost of sales of $18.4 million for fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018. For the thirteen weeks ended June 1, 2019, compared to the thirteen weeks ended June 2, 2018, cost of sales decreased $34.1 million, or 11.3%, from $301.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, to $267.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Average cost per dozen purchased from outside shell egg producers decreased 42.3% due to significantly lower egg selling prices in the quarter. Feed cost per dozen for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 was $0.411, compared to $0.416 for the same quarter of fiscal 2018, a decrease of 1.2%. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 16.4% for fiscal 2019, compared to 24.0% for fiscal 2018.

K., a \u20ac 1.2 billion contract for high-speed trains including maintenance in Russia, a \u20ac 0.8 billion order for trainsets including service in Canada, a \u20ac 0.7 billion contract for diesel-electric locomotives including a service agreement in the U. S. and two orders in Germany worth \u20ac 0.4 billion and \u20ac 0.3 billion, respectively, for regional multiple-unit trainsets. In fiscal 2018, Mobility also gained a number of significant contracts across the regions. Revenue grew slightly as double-digit growth in the customer services business was largely offset by a decline in the rail infrastructure business. Revenue in the rolling stock business remained close to the prior-year level due to unfavorable timing effects related to the execution of large rail projects, which the business began to ramp up late in the fiscal year. Mobility continued to operate with high profitability in fiscal 2019, including a strong contribution to Adjusted EBITA from the services business. Severance charges were \u20ac 20 million, up from \u20ac 14 million in fiscal 2018. Mobility\u2019s order backlog was \u20ac 33 billion at the end of the fiscal year, of which \u20ac 8 billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal 2020. Order growth reflected overall strong markets for Mobility in fiscal 2019, with different dynamics among the regions. Market development in Europe was characterized by continuing awards of mid-size and large orders, particularly in the U. K., Germany and Austria. Within the C. I. S., large projects for high-speed trains and services were awarded in Russia. Demand in the Middle East and Africa was held back by ongoing uncertainties related to budget constraints and political climates. In the Americas region, stable investment activities were driven by demand for mainline\nand urban transport, especially in the U. S. and Canada. Within the Asia, Australia region, Chinese markets saw ongoing investments in high-speed trains, urban transport, freight logistics and rail infrastructure, while India continues to invest in modernizing the country\u2019s transportation infrastructure. For fiscal 2020, we expect markets served by Mobility to grow moderately with increasing demand for digital solutions. Overall, rail transport and intermodal mobility solutions are expected to remain a focus as urbanization continues to progress around the world.

The Group\u2019s revenue increased by $71.6 million, or 11.2 per cent, to $710.6 million in the year-ended 31 March 2019. Subscription revenue was notably strong in the period, with reported growth of 15.9 per cent, or 16.7 per cent on a constant currency basis, because of strong prior-period billings and incremental growth of the MSP channel in the current period. 1 Restated for the adoption of IFRS 15 as explained in note 2 of the Financial Statements Revenue in the period of $710.6 million comprised $394.1 million from the recognition of prior-period deferred revenues and $316.5 million from in-period billings. The majority of the Group\u2019s billings, which are recognised over the life of the contract, relate to subscription products (FY19: 84.8 per cent; FY18: 83.8 per cent), with the benefit from increased billings being spread over a number of years on the subsequent recognition of deferred revenue. The deferred revenue balance at the end of the period of $742.1 million increased $13.5 million year-on-year, an increase of 1.9 per cent. This was mainly due to a net deferral of billings amounting to $49.7 million partially offset by a net currency revaluation of $36.2 million, a consequence of the weakening of the euro and sterling against the US dollar during the year. Deferred revenue due within one year at the balance sheet date of $428.6M increased by 5.1 per cent at actual rates or by 10.7 per cent in constant currency. Revenue in the Americas increased by $29.7 million or 13.3 per cent to $253.3 million in the year-ended 31 March 2019, supported by the recognition of prior-period Enduser billings from the Sophos Central platform and the growth of the MSP channel in the current period. EMEA revenue increased by $39.1 million or 12.0 per cent to $363.6 million in the year-ended 31 March 2019, with growth in Enduser in particular, but also aided by Network sales.

    "context": "Note 4. Special Charges and Other, Net The following table summarizes activity included in the \"special charges and other, net\" caption on the Company's consolidated statements of income (in millions): The Company continuously evaluates its existing operations in an attempt to identify and realize cost savings opportunities and operational efficiencies. This same approach is applied to businesses that are acquired by the Company and often the operating models of acquired companies are not as efficient as the Company's operating model which enables the Company to realize significant savings and efficiencies. As a result, following an acquisition, the Company will from time to time incur restructuring expenses; however, the Company is often not able to estimate the timing or amount of such costs in advance of the period in which they occur. The primary reason for this is that the Company regularly reviews and evaluates each position, contract and expense against the Company's strategic objectives, long-term operating targets and other operational priorities. Decisions related to restructuring activities are made on a \"rolling basis\" during the course of the integration of an acquisition whereby department managers, executives and other leaders work together to evaluate each of these expenses and make recommendations. As a result of this approach, at the time of an acquisition, the Company is not able to estimate the future amount of expected employee separation or exit costs that it will incur in connection with its restructuring activities. The Company's restructuring expenses during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 were related to the Company's most recent business acquisitions, and resulted from workforce, property and other operating expense rationalizations as well as combining product roadmaps and manufacturing operations. These expenses were for employee separation costs and intangible asset impairment charges. The impairment charges in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 were primarily recognized as a result of writing off intangible assets purchased from Microsemi prior to the close of the acquisition and other intangible assets that were impaired as a result of changes in the combined product roadmaps after the acquisition that affected the use and life of the assets. Additional costs will be incurred in the future as additional synergies or operational efficiencies are identified in connection with the Microsemi transaction and other previous acquisitions. The Company is not able to estimate the amount of such future expenses at this time. During fiscal 2018, the Company incurred expenses including non-restructuring contract exit costs of $19.5 million for fees associated with transitioning from the public utility provider in Oregon to a lower cost direct access provider. The fee is paid monthly and will depend on the amount of actual energy consumed by the Company's wafer fabrication facility in Oregon over the next five years. In connection with the transition to a direct access provider, the Company signed a ten-year supply agreement to purchase monthly amounts of energy that are less than the current average usage and priced on a per mega watt hour published index rate in effect at those future dates. Also during fiscal 2018, the Company incurred $1.2 million of employee separation costs in connection with the acquisition of Atmel. The Company's restructuring expenses during fiscal 2017 were related to the Company's acquisitions of Atmel and Micrel, and resulted from workforce, property and other operating expense rationalizations as well as combining product roadmaps and manufacturing operations. These expenses were for employee separation costs, contract exit costs, other operating expenses and intangible asset impairment losses. The impairment charges in fiscal 2017 were recognized as a result of changes in the combined product roadmaps after the acquisition of Atmel that affected the use and life of these assets. At March 31, 2017, these activities were substantially complete. All of the Company's restructuring activities occurred in its semiconductor products segment. The Company incurred $115.2 million in costs since the start of fiscal 2016 in connection with employee separation activities, of which $65.3 million, $1.2 million and $39.1 million was incurred during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company could incur future expenses as additional synergies or operational efficiencies are identified. The Company is not able to estimate future expenses, if any, to be incurred in employee separation costs. The Company has incurred $40.8 million in costs in connection with contract exit activities since the start of fiscal 2016 which includes $4.7 million of income incurred for the year ended March 31, 2019 and $0.7 million and $44.1 million of costs incurred for the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The amounts recognized during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 were primarily related to vacated lease liabilities. While the Company expects to incur further acquisition-related contract exit expenses, it is not able to estimate the amount at this time. In the three months ended June 30, 2017, the Company completed the sale of an asset it acquired as part of its acquisition of Micrel for proceeds of $10.0 million and the gain of $4.4 million is included in the gain on sale of assets in the above table.\nTable:\n\t\tFor The Years Ended March 31,\t\n\t2019\t2018\t2017\nRestructuring\t\t\t\nEmployee separation costs\t$65.3\t$1.2\t$39.1\nGain on sale of assets\t\u2014\t(4.4)\t\u2014\nImpairment charges\t3.6\t\u2014\t12.6\nContract exit costs\t(4.7)\t0.7\t44.1\nOther\t(0.3)\t\u2014\t2.8\nLegal contingencies\t(30.2)\t\u2014\t\u2014\nNon-restructuring contract exit costs and other\t\u2014\t20.0\t\u2014\nTotal\t$33.7\t$17.5\t$98.6",

    "context": "3.4 Trail commission asset Recognition, measurement and classification The Group has elected to account for trail commission revenue at the time of selling a product to which trail commission attaches, rather than on the basis of actual payments received from the relevant fund or providers involved. On initial recognition, trail commission revenue and assets are recognised at expected value. Subsequent to initial recognition and measurement, the carrying amount of the trail commission asset is adjusted to reflect actual and revised estimated cash flows. The resulting adjustment is recognised as revenue or against revenue in profit or loss. Cash receipts that are expected to be received within 12 months of the reporting date are classified as current. All other expected cash receipts are classified as non-current. Key estimates \u2013 trail commission revenue and asset This method of revenue recognition and valuation of trail commission asset requires the Directors and management to make certain estimates and assumptions based on industry data and the historical experience of the Group. Attrition rates in Health are particularly relevant to the overall trail commission asset considering the relative size of the Health trail commission asset. Attrition rates vary substantially by provider and also by the duration of time the policy has been in force, with rates generally higher in policies under two years old. The attrition rates used in the valuation of the Health portfolio at 30 June 2019 ranged from 7.5% and 26.5% (2018: 7.5% and 26.5%). The simple average duration band attrition increase was up to 0.2% during the period, with higher increases experienced for policies that have been in force for shorter periods of time. In undertaking this responsibility, the Group engages Deloitte Actuaries and Consultants Limited, a firm of consulting actuaries, to assist in reviewing the accuracy of assumptions for health, mortgages and life trail revenue.

The following is a summary of the status of the Company's foreign defined benefit pension plans and the net periodic pension cost (dollars in millions): The long term rate of return on plan assets was determined using the weighted-average method, which incorporates factors that include the historical inflation rates, interest rate yield curve and current market conditions.\nTable:\n\t\tYear Ended December 31,\t\n\t2019\t2018\t2017\nService cost\t$9.4\t$9.6\t$10.0\nInterest cost\t5.0\t4.7\t4.3\nExpected return on plan assets\t(6.0)\t(6.1)\t(5.5)\nCurtailment gain\t\u2014\t(0.3)\t\u2014\nActuarial and other loss\t15.6\t6.1\t1.9\nTotal net periodic pension cost\t$24.0\t$14.0\t$10.7\nWeighted average assumptions\t\t\t\nDiscount rate used for net periodic pension costs\t1.74 %\t1.66 %\t1.60 %\nDiscount rate used for pension benefit obligations\t1.43 %\t1.74 %\t1.66 %\nExpected return on plan assets\t3.23 %\t3.18 %\t3.22 %\nRate of compensation increase\t3.07 %\t3.22 %\t3.22 %",

The decrease was primarily driven by a decline in the volume of projects under execution across multiple reporting lines, including power cable repair in offshore renewables, telecom installation work, and a reduction in CWind Group revenue due to focusing on a mix of more profitable projects. Cost of revenue: Cost of revenue from our Marine Services segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $35.9 million to $127.1 million from $163.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was driven by the reduction in revenue, improved vessel utilization, and higher than expected costs on a certain power construction project in the comparable period that were not repeated. Selling, general and administrative: Selling, general and administrative expenses from our Marine Services segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $5.6 million to $25.8 million from $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher disposition costs in the fourth quarter of 2019 related to the sale of the Marine Services segment. This was partially offset by a reversal of an accrual of bad debt expense in the current period due to a favorable receivable settlement during the quarter. See Note 24. Subsequent Events for the summary of the subsequent events. Depreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization from our Marine Services segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $1.5 million to $25.7 million from $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was largely attributable to the disposal of assets during the year. Other operating income: Other operating income decreased $0.7 million from $0.7 million of income for the year ended December 31, 2018, as a result of an impairment expense recorded in 2019 due to the under-utilization of assets on one of the segment's barges.\nTable:\n\t\tYears Ended December 31,\t\n\t2019\t2018\tIncrease / (Decrease)\nNet revenue\t$172.5\t$194.3\t$(21.8)\nCost of revenue\t127.1\t163.0\t(35.9)\nSelling, general and administrative\t25.8\t20.2\t5.6\nDepreciation and amortization\t25.7\t27.2\t(1.5)\nOther operating income\t\u2014\t(0.7)\t0.7\nIncome (loss) from operations\t$(6.1)\t$(15.4)\t$9.3",

Under ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue from sales of systems when the Company determines that control has passed to the customer which is generally (1) for products that have been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment upon shipment or delivery; (2) for products that have not been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment, revenue is recognized upon completion of installation and receipt of customer acceptance; (3) for transactions where legal title does not pass upon shipment or delivery and the Company does not have a right to payment, revenue is recognized when legal title passes to the customer and the Company has a right to payment, which is generally at customer acceptance. The impact of adoption of ASC 606 on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet was as follows: Except as disclosed above, the adoption of ASC 606 did not have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended June 30, 2019. In January 2016, the FASB released ASU 2016-01, \u201cFinancial Instruments \u2013 Overall \u2013 Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.\u201d The FASB issued a subsequent amendment to the initial guidance in February 2018 within ASU 2018-03. These amendments change the accounting for and financial statement presentation of equity investments, other than those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee. The amendments provide clarity on the measurement methodology to be used for the required disclosure of fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet and clarifies that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity\u2019s other deferred tax assets, among other changes. The Company\u2019s adoption of this standard in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 did not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2016, the FASB released ASU 2016-15, \u201cStatement of Cash Flows \u2013 Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.\u201d The amendment provides and clarifies guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows to eliminate diversity in practice. The Company adopted the standard update in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, using a retrospective transition method. The Company\u2019s adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. In October 2016, the FASB released ASU 2016-16, \u201cIncome Tax \u2013 Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory.\u201d This standard update improves the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 using a modified-retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings. The Company\u2019s adoption of this standard resulted in a $0.4 million decrease to retained earnings and a corresponding $0.4 million offset to other assets on its Consolidated Financial Statements. In November 2016, the FASB released ASU 2016-18, \u201cStatement of Cash Flows \u2013 Restricted Cash.\u201d This standard update requires that restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be included in cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown in the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. In February 2018, the FASB released ASU 2018-02, \u201cReclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.\u201d This standard update addresses a specific consequence of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cU.S. Tax Reform\u201d) and allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for the stranded tax effects resulting from U.S. tax reform. Consequently, the update eliminates the stranded tax effects that were created as a result of the historical U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to the newly enacted U.S. federal corporate income tax rate. The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 using a modified-retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings. The adoption of this standard resulted in a $2.2 million increase to retained earnings, with a corresponding $2.2 million decrease to other comprehensive income. In August 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) adopted amendments to eliminate, integrate, update or modify certain of its disclosure requirements. The amendments are part of the SEC\u2019s efforts to improve disclosure effectiveness and were focused on eliminating disclosure requirements that have become redundant, duplicative, overlapping, outdated, or superseded. The Company adopted these amendments in the first quarter of fiscal Year 2019.

As part of the IPO, the Sponsors contributed interests in various projects to OpCo in exchange for voting and economic interests in the entity, and the Partnership acquired an economic interest in OpCo using proceeds from the IPO. In June 2018, we completed the sale of our interests in the Partnership and its subsidiaries to CD Clean Energy and Infrastructure V JV, LLC, an equity fund managed by Capital Dynamics, Inc. and certain other co-investors and other parties, and received net proceeds of $240.0 million after the payment of fees, expenses, and other amounts. We accounted for our interests in OpCo, a subsidiary of the Partnership, under the equity method of accounting as we were able to exercise significant influence over the Partnership due to our representation on the board of directors of its general partner and certain of our associates serving as officers of its general partner. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized equity in earnings, net of tax, of $39.7 million from our investment in OpCo, including a gain of $40.3 million, net of tax, for the sale of our interests in the Partnership and its subsidiaries.

Under the terms of the agreement, we made fixed rent payments to the Partnership\u2019s subsidiary and were entitled to all of the energy generated by the project.

    "context": "FREE CASH FLOW AND DIVIDEND PAYOUT RATIO The terms free cash flow and dividend payout ratio do not have any standardized meaning under IFRS. Therefore, they are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. We define free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities, excluding acquisition and other costs paid (which include significant litigation costs) and voluntary pension funding, less capital expenditures, preferred share dividends and dividends paid by subsidiaries to NCI. We exclude acquisition and other costs paid and voluntary pension funding because they affect the comparability of our financial results and could potentially distort the analysis of trends in business performance. Excluding these items does not imply they are non-recurring. We consider free cash flow to be an important indicator of the financial strength and performance of our businesses because it shows how much cash is available to pay dividends on common shares, repay debt and reinvest in our company. We believe that certain investors and analysts use free cash flow to value a business and its underlying assets and to evaluate the financial strength and performance of our businesses. The most comparable IFRS financial measure is cash flows from operating activities. We define dividend payout ratio as dividends paid on common shares divided by free cash flow. We consider dividend payout ratio to be an important indicator of the financial strength and performance of our businesses because it shows the sustainability of the company\u2019s dividend payments.

    "context": "Revenue and deferred revenue The Group adopted IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers in the current year and has therefore restated the results for the prior-year on a consistent basis, see note 2 of the Financial Statements for further details. The Group\u2019s revenue increased by $71.6 million, or 11.2 per cent, to $710.6 million in the year-ended 31 March 2019. Subscription revenue was notably strong in the period, with reported growth of 15.9 per cent, or 16.7 per cent on a constant currency basis, because of strong prior-period billings and incremental growth of the MSP channel in the current period. 1 Restated for the adoption of IFRS 15 as explained in note 2 of the Financial Statements Revenue in the period of $710.6 million comprised $394.1 million from the recognition of prior-period deferred revenues and $316.5 million from in-period billings. The majority of the Group\u2019s billings, which are recognised over the life of the contract, relate to subscription products (FY19: 84.8 per cent; FY18: 83.8 per cent), with the benefit from increased billings being spread over a number of years on the subsequent recognition of deferred revenue. The deferred revenue balance at the end of the period of $742.1 million increased $13.5 million year-on-year, an increase of 1.9 per cent. This was mainly due to a net deferral of billings amounting to $49.7 million partially offset by a net currency revaluation of $36.2 million, a consequence of the weakening of the euro and sterling against the US dollar during the year. Deferred revenue due within one year at the balance sheet date of $428.6M increased by 5.1 per cent at actual rates or by 10.7 per cent in constant currency. Revenue in the Americas increased by $29.7 million or 13.3 per cent to $253.3 million in the year-ended 31 March 2019, supported by the recognition of prior-period Enduser billings from the Sophos Central platform and the growth of the MSP channel in the current period. EMEA revenue increased by $39.1 million or 12.0 per cent to $363.6 million in the year-ended 31 March 2019, with growth in Enduser in particular, but also aided by Network sales. APJ revenue increased by $2.8 million, or 3.1 per cent to $93.7 million in the year-ended 31 March 2019, with good growth in Enduser products partially offset by a decline in Network sales following the legacy product transition.\nTable:\n\tFY19\tFY18\u00b9\tGrowth %\tGrowth %\n\t$m (Reported)\t$m (Reported)\t(Reported)\t(CC)\nRevenue by Region:\t\t\t\t\n\u2013 Americas\t253.3\t223.6\t13.3\t13.4\n\u2013 EMEA\t363.6\t324.5\t12.0\t12.7\n\u2013 APJ\t93.7\t90.9\t3.1\t6.2\n\t710.6\t639.0\t11.2\t12.0\nRevenue by Product:\t\t\t\t\n\u2013 Network\t328.5\t316.5\t3.8\t4.7\n\u2013 Enduser\t348.4\t291.8\t19.4\t20.2\n\u2013 Other\t33.7\t30.7\t9.8\t10.0\n\t710.6\t639.0\t11.2\t12.0\nRevenue by Type:\t\t\t\t\n\u2013 Subscription\t593.9\t512.4\t15.9\t16.7\n\u2013 Hardware\t106.8\t115.1\t(7.2)\t(6.3)\n\u2013 Other\t9.9\t11.5\t(13.9)\t(12.8)\n\t710.6\t639.0\t11.2\t12.0",

    "context": "14. Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables mainly consist of amounts owed to us by customers and amounts that we pay to our suppliers in advance. Derivative financial instruments with a positive market value are reported within this note as are contract assets, which represent an asset for accrued revenue in respect of goods or services delivered to customers for which a trade receivable does not yet exist. Accounting policies Trade receivables represent amounts owed by customers where the right to payment is conditional only on the passage of time. Trade receivables that are recovered in instalments from customers over an extended period are discounted at market rates and interest revenue is accredited over the expected repayment period. Other trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value. When the Group establishes a practice of selling portfolios of receivables from time to time these portfolios are recorded at fair value through other comprehensive income; all other trade receivables are recorded at amortised cost The carrying value of all trade receivables, contract assets and finance lease receivables recorded at amortised cost is reduced by allowances for lifetime estimated credit losses. Estimated future credit losses are first recorded on the initial recognition of a receivable and are based on the ageing of the receivable balances, historical experience and forward looking considerations. Individual balances are written off when management deems them not to be collectible. Notes: 1 Previously described as accrued income in the year ended 31 March 2018 2 Items are measured at fair value and the valuation basis is level 2 classification, which comprises items where fair value is determined from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly The Group\u2019s trade receivables and contract assets are classified at amortised cost unless stated otherwise and are measured after allowances for future expected credit losses, see note 21 \u201cCapital and financial risk management\u201d for more information on credit risk. The carrying amounts of trade and other receivables, which are measured at amortised cost, approximate their fair value and are predominantly non-interest bearing. The Group\u2019s contract-related costs comprise \u20ac1,433 million relating to costs incurred to obtain customer contracts and \u20ac74 million relating to costs incurred to fulfil customer contracts; an amortisation and impairment expense of \u20ac1,506 million was recognised in operating profit during the year. In January and February 2019 \u20ac57 million and \u20ac70 million, respectively, of trade receivables were reclassified from amortised cost to fair value through other comprehensive income following changes to the Group\u2019s business model under which the balances may be sold to a third party The fair values of the derivative financial instruments are calculated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market interest rates and foreign currency rates prevailing at 31 March.\nTable:\n\t2019\t2018\n\t\u20acm\t\u20acm\nIncluded within non-current assets:\t\t\nTrade receivables\t197\t435\nTrade receivables held at fair value through other comprehensive income\t179\t\u2013\nContract assets1\t531\t350\nContract-related costs\t375\t\u2013\nAmounts owed by associates and joint ventures\t1\t1\nOther receivables\t77\t194\nPrepayments\t371\t597\nDerivative financial instruments2\t3,439\t2,449\n\t5,170\t4,026\nIncluded within current assets:\t\t\nTrade receivables\t4,088\t4,967\nTrade receivables held at fair value through other comprehensive income\t613\t\u2013\nContract assets1\t3,671\t2,257\nContract-related costs\t1,132\t\u2013\nAmounts owed by associates and joint ventures\t388\t524\nOther receivables\t876\t895\nPrepayments\t1,227\t1,152\nDerivative financial instruments2\t195\t180\n\t12,190\t9,975",

    "context": "Summary of Consolidated Cash Flows The below table summarizes the cash provided or used in our activities and the amount of the respective changes between the periods (in millions): Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities was $110.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to cash provided by operating activities of $341.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $230.9 million decrease was the result of the recapture of reinsurance treaties by our Insurance segment in 2018 and was offset in part by improved performance of the Insurance segment subsequent to the KIC acquisition, significant reduction of losses at the Broadcasting segment driven by the cost cutting measures, and an increase in the working capital at our Telecommunications segments. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $263.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to cash used in investing activities of $224.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $39.1 million increase in cash used was a result of (i) an increase in net cash spent at our Insurance segment driven by purchases of investments from the residual cash received from the KIC acquisition and reinsurance recaptures in 2018, (ii) a decrease in cash proceeds received at our Life Sciences segment, from the 2018 upfront payment and 2019 escrow release related to the sale of BeneVir in the prior period, and (iii) an increase in cash used at our Energy segment to acquire ampCNG stations in 2019. These decreases were largely offset by a reduction in cash used by our Construction segment, driven by the acquisition of GrayWolf in 2018, and a reduction in cash used by our Broadcasting segment as less cash was used on its acquisitions in the current year compared to 2018. This was largely offset by a reduction in net cash used by the Insurance segment's purchases of investments, as in the prior period the Insurance segment purchased investments from the cash received from the acquisition of KIC. Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities was $62.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $115.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $52.8 million decrease was a result of a decrease in net borrowings by the Construction and Broadcasting segments, and offset in part by the increase in net borrowings by the Energy segment and Corporate segment, and a decline in cash paid to noncontrolling interest holders driven by the proceeds from our Life Sciences segment's sale of BeneVir in 2018.\nTable:\nYears Ended December 31,\t\t\t\n\t2019\t2018\tIncrease / (Decrease)\nOperating activities\t$110.5\t$341.4\t$(230.9)\nInvesting activities\t(263.7)\t(224.6)\t(39.1)\nFinancing activities\t62.4\t115.2\t(52.8)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\t1.0\t(0.5)\t1.5\nNet decrease in cash,cash equivalents and restricted cash\t$(89.8)\t$231.5\t$(321.3)",

The Company\u2019s deferred tax assets were reviewed for expected utilization by assessing the available positive and negative factors surrounding their recoverability. As of September 30, 2018, the Company\u2019s remaining valuation allowance of approximately $105,000 related to state net operating loss carry forwards. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company reversed approximately $58,000 of its valuation allowance. This consisted of decreasing the valuation allowance for the expiration and utilization of state net operating losses in 2019 of approximately $68,000 and increasing the valuation allowance by approximately $10,000 for future expected NOL utilization based on updated profitability estimates and changes to the loss utilization rules. The remaining valuation allowance balance as of September 30, 2019 of approximately $47,000 relates entirely to state net operating loss carry forwards we do not expect to utilize. The Company will continue to assess the assumptions used to determine the amount of our valuation allowance and may adjust the valuation allowance in future periods based on changes in assumptions of estimated future income and other factors. If the valuation allowance is reduced, we would record an income tax benefit in the period the valuation allowance is reduced.

Market-based PRSUs generally vest three years from the grant date if certain performance criteria are achieved and require continued employment. Based upon the terms of such awards, the number of shares that can be earned over the performance periods is based on the Company\u2019s Common Stock price performance compared to the market price performance of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Sector Index (\u201cSOX\u201d), ranging from 0% to 150% of target.

The target number of shares represented by the market-based PRSUs is increased by 2% of target for each 1% that Common Stock price performance exceeds the market price performance of the SOX index.

Our Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore subsidiaries have $0.4 million, $0.1 million, and $0.2 million of net operating loss carryforwards respectively. The losses for Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore can be carried forward indefinitely. At March 31, 2019 our India subsidiary had $0.4 million of minimum alternative tax credits reported as other noncurrent assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our India subsidiary operates in a \u201cSpecial Economic Zone (\u201cSEZ\u201d)\u201d. One of the benefits associated with the SEZ is that the India subsidiary is not subject to regular India income taxes during its first 5 years of operations. The aggregate value of the benefit of the SEZ during the current fiscal year is $0.5 million. At March 31, 2019 we also had $127.5 million of state net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2020 through 2039. We recorded valuation allowances related to certain deferred income tax assets due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of the future benefits from those assets. At March 31, 2019, the total valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of $57.9 million was comprised of $57.0 million for federal and state deferred tax assets, and $0.9 million associated with deferred tax assets in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities (including the impact of available carryback and carryforward periods), projected taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. In order to fully realize the deferred tax assets, we will need to generate future taxable income before the expiration of the deferred tax assets governed by the tax code. Because of our losses in current and prior periods, management believes that it is more-likely-than-not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. The amount of the valuation allowance, however, could be reduced in the near term. The exact timing will be based on the level of profitability that we are able to achieve and our visibility into future results. Our recorded tax rate may increase in subsequent periods following a valuation release. Any valuation allowance release will not affect the amount of cash paid for income taxes. The undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are not subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes unless such earnings are distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits. The undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested and totaled $3.1 million and $1.7 million as of March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We made the determination of permanent reinvestment on the basis of sufficient evidence that demonstrates we will invest the undistributed earnings overseas indefinitely for use in working capital, as well as foreign acquisitions and expansion. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we used the with-and-without approach for ordering tax benefits derived from the share-based payment awards. Using the with-and-without approach, actual income taxes payable for the period were compared to the amount of tax payable that would have been incurred absent the deduction for employee share-based payments in excess of the amount of compensation cost recognized for financial reporting. As a result of this approach, tax net operating loss carryforwards not generated from share-based payments in excess of cost recognized for financial reporting were considered utilized before the current period's share-based deduction.\nTable:\n(In thousands)\t2019\t2018\nDeferred tax assets:\t\t\nAccrued liabilities\t$3,944\t$2,720\nAllowance for doubtful accounts\t120\t143\nInventory valuation reserve\t41\t20\nFederal losses and credit carryforwards\t45,227\t42,713\nForeign net operating losses\t730\t623\nState losses and credit carryforwards\t9,886\t9,592\nDeferred revenue\t488\t652\nGoodwill and other intangible assets\t\u2014\t286\nOther\t65\t96\n\t60,501\t56,845\nLess: valuation allowance\t(57,852)\t(54,260)\nTotal\t2,649\t2,585\nDeferred tax liabilities:\t\t\nProperty and equipment & software amortization\t(361)\t(412)\nGoodwill and other intangible assets\t(2,706)\t(2,277)\nTotal\t(3,067)\t(2,689)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\t$(418)\t$(104)",

As of June 30, 2019, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2018, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nTable:\n(In millions)\t\t\t\nYear Ended June 30,\t2019\t2018\t2017\nBeginning unrecognized tax benefits\t$ 11,961\t$ 11,737\t$ 10,164\nDecreases related to settlements\t(316)\t(193)\t(4)\nIncreases for tax positions related to the current year\t2,106\t1,445\t1,277\nIncreases for tax positions related to prior years\t508\t151\t397\nDecreases for tax positions related to prior years\t(1,113)\t(1,176)\t(49)\nDecreases due to lapsed statutes of limitations\t0\t(3)\t(48)\nEnding unrecognized tax benefits\t$  13,146\t$  11,961\t$  11,737",

    "context": "The components of net deferred income tax assets for income tax purposes are as follows (in thousands): The net deferred tax assets as of February 28, 2018 in the above table include the deferred tax assets of our Italian and Canadian subsidiaries amounting to $7.4 million and $7.6 million, respectively, which were disclosed narratively in the fiscal 2018 Form 10-K. The deferred tax assets primarily relate to net operating losses (NOL\u2019s) and research and development expenditure pool carryforwards. We had provided a 100% valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets at February 28, 2018, as it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would not be realized. As of February 28, 2019 and 2018, we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to certain of our deferred tax assets relating primarily to NOL\u2019s in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions and certain state tax credits that we believe are not likely to be realized. During fiscal 2019, we decreased the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by approximately $5.9 million, as it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets would be realized based upon the assessment of positive and negative evidence. This reduction in our valuation allowance is primarily attributable to a release of valuation allowance against foreign deferred tax assets, partially offset by an increase in valuation allowances for state tax credits. At February 28, 2019, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $30.1 million, $60.8 million and $44.7 million for federal, state and foreign purposes, respectively, expiring at various dates through fiscal 2039. Approximately $18.3 million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire. The federal net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. If substantial changes in our ownership were to occur, there may be certain annual limitations on the amount of the NOL carryforwards that can be utilized As of February 28, 2019, we had R&D tax credit carryforwards of $9.1 million and $8.9 million for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. The federal R&D tax credits expire at various dates through 2039. A substantial portion of the state R&D tax credits have no expiration date. We adopted the updated guidance on stock based compensation and we have tax deductions on exercised stock options and vested restricted stock awards that exceed stock compensation expense amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes. The gross excess tax deductions were $2.9 million, $2.6 and $0 in fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Under the new guidance, all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies are recognized in the income statement as they occur. We follow ASC Topic 740, \u201cIncome Taxes,\u201d which clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. Management determined based on our evaluation of our income tax positions that we have uncertain tax benefit of $3.2 million, $1.0 million and $1.0 million on at February 28, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, for which we have not yet recognized an income tax benefit for financial reporting purposes. At February 28, 2019, we increased the uncertain tax benefits related to certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards. Such deferred tax assets were previously offset by a valuation allowance so that the increase in the unrecognized tax benefit coupled with the reduction of the valuation allowance on such net operating losses did not result in an income tax expense during the current fiscal year. If total uncertain tax benefits were realized in a future period, it would result in a tax benefit of $3.2 million. As of February 28, 2019, our liabilities for uncertain tax benefits were netted against our deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet. It is reasonably possible the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced within the next 12 months by at least $0.6 million. We recognize interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. No amounts of interest and/or penalties have been accrued as of February 28, 2019.\nTable:\n\t\tFebruary 28,\n\t2019\t2018\nNet operating loss carryforwards\t$19,269\t$22,013\nDepreciation, amortization and impairments\t(11,945)\t(11,112)\nResearch and development credits\t19,189\t17,432\nStock-based compensation\t2,783\t2,376\nOther tax credits\t1,018\t2,015\nInventory reserve\t624\t292\nWarranty reserve\t313\t429\nPayroll and employee benefit accruals\t2,220\t1,941\nAllowance for doubtful accounts\t454\t354\nOther accrued liabilities\t6,208\t8,975\nConvertible debt\t(10,822)\t(194)\nOther, net\t3,281\t3,904\nGross deferred tax assets\t32,592\t48,425\nValuation allowance\t(10,929)\t(16,844)\nNet deferred tax assets\t$21,663\t$31,581\nReported as:\t\t\nDeferred tax assets\t$22,626\t$31,581\nDeferred tax liabilities\t(963)\t-\nNet deferred tax assets\t$21,663\t$31,581",

As part of the IPO, the Sponsors contributed interests in various projects to OpCo in exchange for voting and economic interests in the entity, and the Partnership acquired an economic interest in OpCo using proceeds from the IPO. In June 2018, we completed the sale of our interests in the Partnership and its subsidiaries to CD Clean Energy and Infrastructure V JV, LLC, an equity fund managed by Capital Dynamics, Inc. and certain other co-investors and other parties, and received net proceeds of $240.0 million after the payment of fees, expenses, and other amounts. We accounted for our interests in OpCo, a subsidiary of the Partnership, under the equity method of accounting as we were able to exercise significant influence over the Partnership due to our representation on the board of directors of its general partner and certain of our associates serving as officers of its general partner. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized equity in earnings, net of tax, of $39.7 million from our investment in OpCo, including a gain of $40.3 million, net of tax, for the sale of our interests in the Partnership and its subsidiaries.

    "context": "Free cash flow The Group reported an inflow of Free cash in the period of \u00a329.2m. Trading profit of \u00a3128.5m was \u00a35.5m ahead of the prior year for the reasons outlined above, while depreciation of \u00a317.0m was slightly higher than 2017/18. Other non-cash items of \u00a32.4m was predominantly due to share based payments. Net interest paid was \u00a37.9m lower in the year at \u00a330.1m, reflecting the timing of interest payable on the \u00a3300m fixed rate notes due October 2023 which were issued in the first half of the year. This is a one-off benefit to cash interest paid; in 2019/20 cash interest is expected to be in the range of \u00a335-39m. No taxation was paid in the period due to the availability of brought forward losses and capital allowances, however, a payment of \u00a31.0m was received in the prior period from Irish tax authorities in respect of tax paid in prior years. Pension contributions in the year were \u00a341.9m, in line with expectations, and \u00a32.1m higher than the prior year. Pension deficit contribution payments made to the Premier Foods pension schemes of \u00a334.9m were the largest component of cash paid in the year; the balance being expenses connected to administering both the RHM and Premier Foods schemes and government levies. Pension deficit contribution payments in 2019/20 are expected to be \u00a337m and administration and government levy costs approximately \u00a36-8m. Capital expenditure was \u00a317.7m in the year, \u00a31.5m lower than the prior year. In 2019/20, the Group expects to increase its capital expenditure to circa \u00a325m to fund investment in both growth projects supporting the Group\u2019s innovation strategy and cost release projects to deliver efficiency savings. For example, the Group is investing in one of its lines at its Stoke cake manufacturing site which will provide enhanced and varied product innovation capabilities. Working capital investment was \u00a37.7m in the year compared to \u00a30.6m in 2017/18. Part of this movement reflected higher stock levels in anticipation of the original planned date to leave the European Union to protect the Company against the risk of delays at ports. Restructuring costs were \u00a318.1m compared to \u00a312.5m in the comparative period. These were predominantly associated with implementation costs of the Group\u2019s logistics transformation programme and also advisory costs connected with the potential disposal of the Ambrosia brand which has since concluded. Financing fees of \u00a312.2m relate to costs associated with the extension of the Group\u2019s revolving credit facility and the issue of new \u00a3300m Senior secured fixed rate notes early in the financial year. This comprised \u00a35.6m due to the early redemption of previously issued fixed rate notes due March 2021 and \u00a36.6m of other fees associated with the issue of the new fixed rate notes and extension of the Group\u2019s revolving credit facility. The Group received a partial repayment of its loan note and associated interest from Hovis of \u00a37.6m in the year. There is the possibility of the Group receiving a second tranche during 2019/20. On a statutory basis, cash generated from operations was \u00a380.2m compared to \u00a389.4m in 2017/18. Cash generated from operating activities was \u00a357.7m in the year after deducting net interest paid of \u00a322.5m, which includes the partial repayment of the loan note from Hovis as described above. Cash used in investing activities was \u00a317.7m in 2018/19 compared to \u00a317.9m in the prior year. Cash used in financing activities was \u00a335.8m in the year versus \u00a37.2m cash generated in 2017/18. This was due to the repayment of the \u00a3325m fixed rate notes due March 2021, partly offset by proceeds received from the issue of \u00a3300m floating rate notes due October 2023 and the payment of financing fees as described above. At 30 March 2019, the Group held cash and bank deposits of \u00a327.8m compared to \u00a323.6m at 31 March 2018 and the Group\u2019s revolving credit facility was undrawn.\nTable:\nAdjusted earnings per share (\u00a3m)\t2018/19\t2017/18\nTrading profit\t128.5\t123.0\nDepreciation\t17.0\t16.6\nOther non-cash items\t2.4\t2.8\nInterest\t(30.1)\t(38.0)\nTaxation\t\u2013\t1.0\nPension contributions\t(41.9)\t(39.8)\nCapital expenditure\t(17.7)\t(19.2)\nWorking capital and other\t(7.7)\t(0.6)\nRestructuring costs\t(18.1)\t(12.5)\nProceeds from share issue\t1.4\t1.2\nSale of property, plant and equipment\t\u2013\t1.3\nHovis repayment of loan note\t7.6\t\u2013\nFinancing fees\t(12.2)\t(7.0)\nFree cash flow10\t29.2\t28.8\nStatutory cash flow statement\t\t\nCash generated from operating activities\t57.7\t52.4\nCash used in investing activities\t(17.7)\t(17.9)\nCash (used in)/generated from financing activities\t(35.8)\t7.2\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents\t4.2\t41.7",

Adjusted EBITDA also includes rent paid in the period related to locations that are accounted for as build-to-suit facilities. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides investors and other users of our financial information consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations and facilitates comparisons with our peer companies, many of which use a similar non-GAAP financial measure to supplement their GAAP results. We use Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with traditional GAAP operating performance measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance, and for establishing incentive compensation metrics for executives and other senior employees. We do not place undue reliance on Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of operating performance. This non-GAAP measure should not be considered as a substitute for other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations to using a non-GAAP financial measure, including that other companies may calculate this measure differently than we do, that it does not reflect our capital expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures and that it does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital.

Net voyage revenues divided by the number of days on the charter provides the Time Charter Equivalent (TCE) Rate. Net voyage revenues and TCE rates are widely used by investors and analysts in the tanker shipping industry for comparing the financial performance of companies and for preparing industry averages.

    "context": "Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2019, our contractual obligations were as follows: (1) Interest on long-term debt includes amounts due on fixed and variable rate debt. As the rates on our variable debt are subject to change, the rates in effect at December 31, 2019 were used in determining our future interest obligations. Expected settlements of interest rate swap agreements were estimated using yield curves in effect at December 31, 2019. (2) Unrecorded purchase obligations include binding commitments for future capital expenditures and service and maintenance agreements to support various computer hardware and software applications and certain equipment. If we terminate any of the contracts prior to their expiration date, we would be liable for minimum commitment payments as defined by the contractual terms of the contracts. (3) Recorded obligations include amounts in accounts payable and accrued expenses for external goods and services received as of December 31, 2019 and expected to be settled in cash. (4) Expected contributions to our pension and post-retirement benefit plans for the next 5 years. Actual contributions could differ from these estimates and extend beyond 5 years. Defined Benefit Pension Plans As required, we contribute to qualified defined pension plans and non-qualified supplemental retirement plans (collectively the \u201cPension Plans\u201d) and other post-retirement benefit plans, which provide retirement benefits to certain eligible employees. Contributions are intended to provide for benefits attributed to service to date. Our funding policy is to contribute annually an actuarially determined amount consistent with applicable federal income tax regulations. The cost to maintain our Pension Plans and future funding requirements are affected by several factors including the expected return on investment of the assets held by the Pension Plans, changes in the discount rate used to calculate pension expense and the amortization of unrecognized gains and losses. Returns generated on the Pension Plans assets have historically funded a significant portion of the benefits paid under the Pension Plans. We used a weighted-average expected long-term rate of return of 6.97% and 7.03% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of January 1, 2020, we estimate the longterm rate of return of Plan assets will be 6.25%. The Pension Plans invest in marketable equity securities which are exposed to changes in the financial markets. If the financial markets experience a downturn and returns fall below our estimate, we could be required to make material contributions to the Pension Plans, which could adversely affect our cash flows from operations. Net pension and post-retirement costs were $11.5 million, $5.6 million and $3.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We contributed $27.5 million, $26.2 million and $12.5 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively to our Pension Plans. For our other post-retirement plans, we contributed $8.5 million, $9.7 million and $6.5 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In 2020, we expect to make contributions totaling approximately $25.0 million to our Pension Plans and $8.9 million to our other post-retirement benefit plans. Our contribution amounts meet the minimum funding requirements as set forth in employee benefit and tax laws.

These liabilities were estimated using Level 3 inputs. The fair value of contingent consideration was determined based on a probability-based approach which includes projected results, percentage probability of occurrence and the application of a discount rate to present value the payments. A significant change in projected results, discount rate, or probabilities of occurrence could result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. Changes in the fair value of contingent earn-out liabilities are reflected in operating expenses on the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations. The following table presents the changes in Level 3 contingent earn-out liabilities: In May 2019, the Company fully settled its Del Monte earn-out liability for $200.

Significant deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the following: Of the $32.7 million and $40.2 million net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, $42.7 million and $47.1 million is reflected as a net non-current deferred tax asset and $10.0 million and $7.0 million is reflected as a long-term liability at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance on $16.0 million of its U.S. domestic deferred tax assets, largely attributable to acquired federal capital loss carryforwards for which the Company does not have sufficient income in the character to realize that attribute, and state carryforward attributes that are expected to expire before sufficient income can be realized in those jurisdictions. The remaining valuation allowance on deferred tax assets approximates $60.2 million and is associated primarily with operations in Austria, Germany, Hong Kong and Switzerland. As of December 31, 2019, there is not sufficient positive evidence to conclude that such deferred tax assets, presently reduced by a valuation allowance, will be recognized. The December 31, 2019 valuation allowance balance reflects an increase of $45.3 million during the year. The change in the valuation allowance is primarily due to increases from acquired Artesyn positions and current year activity, partially offset by decreases due to foreign exchange movements\nTable:\n\tYears Ended December 31,\t\n\t2019\t2018\nDeferred tax assets\t\t\nStock based compensation\t$1,757\t$1,337\nNet operating loss and tax credit carryforwards\t86,879\t38,622\nInterest expense limitation\t7,620\t\u2014\nPension obligation\t13,473\t3,302\nExcess and obsolete inventory\t3,217\t2,161\nDeferred revenue\t3,305\t6,903\nEmployee bonuses and commissions\t2,537\t1,874\nDepreciation and amortization\t29,015\t29,525\nOperating lease liabilities\t23,451\t\u2014\nOther\t9,685\t9,961\nDeferred tax assets\t180,939\t93,685\nLess: Valuation allowance\t(76,206)\t(30,924)\nNet deferred tax assets\t104,733\t62,761\nDeferred tax liabilities\t\t\nDepreciation and amortization\t41,549\t17,723\nUnremitted earnings\t4,740\t3,529\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\t22,774\t\u2014\nOther\t2,966\t1,267\nDeferred tax liabilities\t72,029\t22,519\nNet deferred tax assets\t$32,704\t$40,242",

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we had an average of 23.0 ships operating in our owned and bareboat fleet having 8,317 operating days and an average of 23.4 ships operating under our technical management (including 22.0 of our owned ships). Revenues: Revenues increased by 17.7%, or $93.1 million, from $525.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $618.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in revenues is mainly attributable to an increase of $64.2 million in revenues from our vessels operating in the spot market due to the significant increase in LNG shipping spot rates during the year. There was also an increase in revenues of $63.7 million due to the deliveries of the GasLog Houston, the GasLog Hong Kong and the GasLog Genoa (which were delivered on January 8, 2018, March 20, 2018 and March 29, 2018, respectively). These deliveries resulted in an increase in operating days. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $25.4 million due to the expiration of the initial time charters of the GasLog Shanghai, the GasLog Santiago and the GasLog Sydney. Following the expiration of their initial charters, the GasLog Shanghai has been trading in the spot market through the Cool Pool, the GasLog Santiago began a new, multi-year charter with Trafigura and the GasLog Sydney began a new 18-month charter with Cheniere. There was also a decrease of $8.4 million due to increased off-hire days for four scheduled dry-dockings in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to only one scheduled dry-docking in the same period of 2017 and a decrease of $0.7 million due to increased off-hire days from the remaining vessels. The average daily hire rate increased from $63,006 for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $68,392 for the year ended December 31, 2018. Furthermore, there was a decrease of $0.3 million in revenues from technical management services mainly due to the decrease in the average number of the managed vessels owned by third parties.\nTable:\n\t\tYear ended December 31,\t\n\t2017\t2018\tChange\nAmounts are in thousands of U.S. Dollars\t\t\t\nRevenues\t$525,229\t$618,344\t$93,115\nNet pool allocation\t7,254\t17,818\t10,564\nVoyage expenses and commissions\t(15,404)\t(20,374)\t(4,970)\nVessel operating and supervision costs\t(122,486)\t(128,084)\t(5,598)\nDepreciation\t(137,187)\t(153,193)\t(16,006)\nGeneral and administrative expenses\t(39,850)\t(41,993)\t(2,143)\nProfit from operations\t217,556\t292,518\t74,962\nFinancial costs\t(139,181)\t(166,627)\t(27,446)\nFinancial income\t2,650\t4,784\t2,134\nGain/(loss) on derivatives\t2,025\t(6,077)\t(8,102)\nShare of profit of associates\t1,159\t1,800\t641\nTotal other expenses, net\t(133,347)\t(166,120)\t(32,773)\nProfit for the year\t84,209\t126,398\t42,189\nNon-controlling interests\t68,703\t78,715\t10,012\nProfit attributable to owners of the Group\t$15,506\t$47,683\t$32,177",

BG Group was acquired by Shell on February 15, 2016. This acquisition does not impact the contractual obligations under the existing charter party agreements. The Group did not experience significant credit losses on its accounts receivable portfolio during the three years ended December 31, 2019. The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the consolidated financial statements represents the Group\u2019s maximum exposure to credit risk. Management monitors exposure to credit risk, and they believe that there is no substantial credit risk arising from the Group\u2019s counterparties. The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.\nTable:\n\tAs of December 31,\t\n\t2018\t2019\nCash and cash equivalents\t342,594\t263,747\nShort-term investments\t25,000\t4,500\nTrade and other receivables\t20,244\t24,900\nDividends receivable and other amounts due from related parties\t33,395\t573\nDerivative financial instruments\t15,188\t4,001",

This increase is the result of increases to the valuation allowances against the net deferred tax assets in the AMER region of $1.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in net deferred tax assets in the EMEA region of $0.9 million. As of September 28, 2019, the Company had approximately $189.2 million of pre-tax state net operating loss carryforwards that expire between fiscal 2020 and 2040.

The cumulative impact of applying the new guidance to all contracts with customers that were not completed as of April 1, 2018 was recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the adoption date. As a result of applying the modified retrospective method to adopt the new standard, the following adjustments were made to noted accounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of April 1, 2018: The acceleration of revenue that was deferred under prior guidance as of the adoption date was primarily attributable to the requirement of Topic 606 to allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract on a relative basis using SSP rather than allocating under the residual method, which allocates the entire arrangement discount to the delivered performance obligations. Due to the Company's full valuation allowance as of the adoption date, there is no tax impact associated with the adoption of Topic 606. We made certain presentation changes to our Consolidated Balance Sheet on April 1, 2018 to comply with Topic 606.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND OTHER FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES The majority of NAT and its subsidiaries\u2019 transactions, assets and liabilities are denominated in United States dollars, the functional currency of the Company. There is no significant risk that currency fluctuations will have a negative effect on the value of the Company\u2019s cash flows. The Company categorizes its fair value estimates using a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to measure fair value for those assets that are recorded on the Balance Sheet at fair value. The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value as follows: Level 1. Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date. Level 2. Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and Level 3. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments and other financial assets. - \u00a0The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, is a reasonable estimate of fair value. - \u00a0The estimated fair value for the long-term debt is considered to be equal to the carrying values since it bears spreads and variable interest rates which approximate market rates.

    "context": "The following table presents the principal components of the difference between the effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate for the years ended March 31: During fiscal 2018, we recorded a provisional tax benefit of approximately $3.3 million as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\") on December 22, 2017. We completed the accounting for the Tax Act during Q3 fiscal 2019 and recorded an adjustment on December 31, 2018 of $0.2 million to increase our deferred tax liability associated with certain indefinite lived intangibles. We have elected to account for global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) inclusions in the period in which they are incurred. Our tax provision includes a provision for income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions where subsidiaries are profitable, but only a minimal benefit is reflected related to U.S. and certain foreign tax losses due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of future benefits from these losses. The 2019 tax provision results primarily from foreign tax expense, the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions and the completion of our accounting for the Tax Act. The 2019 tax provision differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, state taxes and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. The 2018 tax provision primarily results from a reduction in the deferred rate and the ability to offset indefinite lived deferred tax liabilities with certain deferred tax assets due to passage of the Tax Act. The 2018 effective rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of the Tax Act, recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, certain foreign and state tax effects including a benefit of $0.4 million related to a settlement with the California Franchise Tax Board and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. The 2017 tax provision primarily results from state taxes, taxes withheld in foreign jurisdictions and foreign tax expense.

A total of 500,000 shares were initially reserved for issuance under the Plan. The Plan was amended several times since then to eventually increase the authorized shares to 2,500,000 as of December 31, 2019. A total of 1,624,221 shares of common stock underlying options were outstanding at December 31, 2019. The Company had 236,614 remaining shares available to grant under the Plan at December 31, 2019. The Plan allows the Company to grant incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, or restricted stock. The incentive stock options are exercisable for up to ten years, at an option price per share not less than the fair market value on the date the option is granted. The incentive stock options are limited to persons who are regular full-time employees of the Company at the date of the grant of the option. Non-qualified options may be granted to any person, including, but not limited to, employees, independent agents, consultants and attorneys, who the Company\u2019s Board or Compensation Committee believes have contributed, or will contribute, to the success of the Company. Non-qualified options may be issued at option prices of less than fair market value on the date of grant and may be exercisable for up to ten years from date of grant. The option vesting schedule for options granted is determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors at the time of the grant. The Plan provides for accelerated vesting of unvested options if there is a change in control, as defined in the Plan. The compensation cost that has been charged against income related to options for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, was $1,687,745 and $1,317,904, respectively.

The decrease was partially offset by an $18.1 million increase in production ramps of new products for existing customers and a $4.5 million increase in production ramps for new customers.\nTable:\nMarket Sector \t2019\t2018\nHealthcare/Life Sciences \t$1,220.0\t$1,039.9\nIndustrial/Commercial \t981.2\t917.7\nAerospace/Defense \t588.6\t445.1\nCommunications \t374.6\t470.8\nTotal net sales\t3,164.4\t2,873.5",

    "context": "The significant components of the Company\u2019s deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 are as follows: In July 2019, the Company formally established its EMEA headquarters in Ireland and its Asia-Pacific headquarters in Singapore. As a result of these actions, the Company transferred regional relationship and territory rights from its Canadian entity to enable each regional headquarters to develop and maintain merchant and commercial operations within its respective region, while keeping the ownership of all of the Company's current developed technology within Canada. These transfers reflect the growing proportion of the Company's business occurring internationally and resulted in a one-time capital gain. As a result of the capital gain, ongoing operations, the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the utilization of all applicable credits and other tax attributes, including loss carryforwards, the Company has a provision for income taxes of $29,027 in the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company released some of its valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets in Canada, the United States, and Sweden. In the third quarter of 2019, the Company released a portion of its valuation allowance against its Canadian deferred tax assets as a result of the capital gain from the transfer of the regional relationship and territory rights. In the United States, as a result of the acquisition of 6RS the Company released a portion of its valuation allowance during its fourth quarter against deferred tax assets on its United States net operating losses. The Company has provided for deferred income taxes for the estimated tax cost of distributable earnings of its subsidiaries of $292. The Company had no material uncertain income tax positions for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The Company's accounting policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. In the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there was no interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. The Company remains subject to audit by the relevant tax authorities for the years ended 2012 through 2019. Investment tax credits, which are earned as a result of qualifying R&D expenditures, are recognized and applied to reduce income tax expense in the year in which the expenditures are made and their realization is reasonably assured. As at December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had unused non-capital tax losses of approximately $209,759 and $53,941 respectively. Of the December 31, 2019 balance, $150,707 of the non-capital tax losses do not expire, while the remaining non-capital losses of $59,052 are due to expire between 2033 and 2039. The Company has U.S. state losses of $298,998 as at December 31, 2019 (December 31, 2018 - $116,026). There is no SR&ED expenditure pool balance as at December 31, 2019 (December 31, 2018 - $9,575). In addition, at December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had investment tax credits of $2,111 and $4,179, respectively. The investment tax credits are due to expire between 2035 and 2039.

    "context": "Other non-operating results The following details our other consolidated results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017: Interest income: Interest income increased by $4.2 million to $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $5.9 million for the same period in 2017 due to returns on our fixed deposits that had been made in 2018, and income derived from the lending capital of our lessor VIEs, that we are required to consolidate under U.S. GAAP. Interest expense: Interest expense increased by $42.6 million to $101.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $59.3 million for the same period in 2017. In addition to higher LIBOR rates, this was primarily due to:\n\u2022 $22.7 million increase in interest expense arising on the loan facilities of our consolidated lessor VIEs (refer to note 5 \"Variable Interest Entities (\"VIE\")\" of our consolidated financial statements included herein), in particular on the Hilli post-delivery sale and leaseback arrangement entered into during June 2018;\n\u2022 $21.7 million lower capitalized interest on borrowing costs in relation to our investment in the Hilli FLNG conversion prior to acceptance of the vessel;\n\u2022 $7.0 million increase in amortization of deferred financing costs in relation to the Hilli facility; and\n\u2022 $1.4 million increase in interest expense in relation to the $402.5 million convertible bond issued in February 2017, resulting in a full year of interest incurred in 2018. This was partially offset by a decrease of:\n\u2022 $5.9 million in interest expense relating to the Hilli disposal; and\n\u2022 $5.0 million higher capitalized interest on borrowing costs in relation to our investment in Golar Power. (Losses)/gains on derivative instruments: Losses on derivative instruments increased by $51.2 million to a loss of $30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to a gain of $20.7 million for the same period in 2017. The movement was primarily due to: Net unrealized and realized gains on interest rate swap agreements: As of December 31, 2018, we have an interest rate swap portfolio with a notional amount of $950 million, none of which are designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Net unrealized gains on the interest rate swaps decreased to a gain of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to a gain of $6.6 million for the same period in 2017, due to an improvement in the long-term swap rates, offset by the decreased notional value of the swap portfolio over the period. Realized gains on our interest rate swaps increased to a gain of $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to a loss of $3.8 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher LIBOR rates for the year ended December 31, 2018. Unrealized (losses) gains on Total Return Swap (or equity swap): In December 2014, we established a three month facility for a Stock Indexed Total Return Swap Programme or Equity Swap Line with DNB Bank ASA in connection with a share buyback scheme. The facility has been extended to June 2019. The equity swap derivatives mark-to-market adjustment resulted in a net loss of $30.7 million recognized in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to a gain of $16.6 million for the same period in 2017. The loss in 2018 is due to the fall in our share price during 2018. Unrealized mark-to-market losses on Earn-Out Units: This relates to the mark-to-market movement on the Earn-Out Units issuable in connection with the IDR reset transaction in October 2016, which we recognize as a derivative asset in our consolidated financial statements. The decrease in Golar Partners' quarterly distribution to $0.4042 per common unit on October 24, 2018 resulted in the contingent Earn-Out Units arising out of the IDR reset transaction in October 2016 not crystallizing and, accordingly, we recognized a mark-to-market loss of $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, effectively reducing the derivative asset to $nil at December 31, 2018, compared to a gain of $0.4 million for the same period in 2017. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests: The net income attributable to non-controlling interests comprises of (i) $19.7 million and $1.5 million in relation to the non-controlling shareholders who hold interests in Hilli LLC and Hilli Corp (prior to the incorporation of Hilli LLC) for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and (ii) $43.5 million and $32.9 million in relation to the equity interests in our lessor VIEs for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nTable:\n\t\tDecember 31,\t\t\n(in thousands of $)\t2018\t2017\tChange\t% Change\nTotal other non-operating expense\t\u2014\t(81)\t81\t(100)%\nInterest income\t10,133\t5,890\t4,243\t72%\nInterest expense\t(101,908)\t(59,305)\t(42,603)\t72%\n(Losses)/gains on derivative instruments\t(30,541)\t20,696\t(51,237)\t(248)%\nOther financial items, net\t(1,481)\t(69)\t(1,412)\t2,046%\nIncome taxes\t(1,267)\t(1,505)\t238\t(16)%\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests\t(63,214)\t(34,424)\t(28,790)\t84%",

ILS delivers high performance laser sources, sub-systems and tools primarily used for industrial laser materials processing, serving important end markets like automotive, machine tool, consumer goods and medical device manufacturing. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the amount of net sales and their relative percentages of total net sales by segment (dollars in thousands): Net sales for fiscal 2019 decreased $471.9 million, or 25%, compared to fiscal 2018, with decreases of $372.8 million, or 30%, in our OLS segment and decreases of $99.1 million, or 15%, in our ILS segment. The fiscal 2019 decreases in both OLS and ILS segment sales included decreases due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. The decrease in our OLS segment sales in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to weaker demand resulting in lower shipments of ELA tools used in the flat panel display market and lower revenues from consumable service parts. The decrease in our ILS segment sales from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to lower sales for materials processing and microelectronics applications, partially offset by higher sales for medical and military applications within the OEM components and instrumentation market.\nTable:\n\tFiscal 2019\t\tFiscal 2018\t\n\tAmount\tPercentage of total net sales\tAmount\tPercentage of total net sales\nOEM Laser Sources (OLS)\t$886,676\t62.0%\t$1,259,477\t66.2%\nIndustrial Lasers & Systems (ILS)\t543,964\t38.0%\t643,096\t33.8%\nTotal\t$1,430,640\t100.0%\t$1,902,573\t100.0%",

    "context": "Revenue and deferred revenue The Group adopted IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers in the current year and has therefore restated the results for the prior-year on a consistent basis, see note 2 of the Financial Statements for further details. The Group\u2019s revenue increased by $71.6 million, or 11.2 per cent, to $710.6 million in the year-ended 31 March 2019. Subscription revenue was notably strong in the period, with reported growth of 15.9 per cent, or 16.7 per cent on a constant currency basis, because of strong prior-period billings and incremental growth of the MSP channel in the current period. 1 Restated for the adoption of IFRS 15 as explained in note 2 of the Financial Statements Revenue in the period of $710.6 million comprised $394.1 million from the recognition of prior-period deferred revenues and $316.5 million from in-period billings. The majority of the Group\u2019s billings, which are recognised over the life of the contract, relate to subscription products (FY19: 84.8 per cent; FY18: 83.8 per cent), with the benefit from increased billings being spread over a number of years on the subsequent recognition of deferred revenue. The deferred revenue balance at the end of the period of $742.1 million increased $13.5 million year-on-year, an increase of 1.9 per cent. This was mainly due to a net deferral of billings amounting to $49.7 million partially offset by a net currency revaluation of $36.2 million, a consequence of the weakening of the euro and sterling against the US dollar during the year. Deferred revenue due within one year at the balance sheet date of $428.6M increased by 5.1 per cent at actual rates or by 10.7 per cent in constant currency. Revenue in the Americas increased by $29.7 million or 13.3 per cent to $253.3 million in the year-ended 31 March 2019, supported by the recognition of prior-period Enduser billings from the Sophos Central platform and the growth of the MSP channel in the current period. EMEA revenue increased by $39.1 million or 12.0 per cent to $363.6 million in the year-ended 31 March 2019, with growth in Enduser in particular, but also aided by Network sales. APJ revenue increased by $2.8 million, or 3.1 per cent to $93.7 million in the year-ended 31 March 2019, with good growth in Enduser products partially offset by a decline in Network sales following the legacy product transition.\nTable:\n\tFY19\tFY18\u00b9\tGrowth %\tGrowth %\n\t$m (Reported)\t$m (Reported)\t(Reported)\t(CC)\nRevenue by Region:\t\t\t\t\n\u2013 Americas\t253.3\t223.6\t13.3\t13.4\n\u2013 EMEA\t363.6\t324.5\t12.0\t12.7\n\u2013 APJ\t93.7\t90.9\t3.1\t6.2\n\t710.6\t639.0\t11.2\t12.0\nRevenue by Product:\t\t\t\t\n\u2013 Network\t328.5\t316.5\t3.8\t4.7\n\u2013 Enduser\t348.4\t291.8\t19.4\t20.2\n\u2013 Other\t33.7\t30.7\t9.8\t10.0\n\t710.6\t639.0\t11.2\t12.0\nRevenue by Type:\t\t\t\t\n\u2013 Subscription\t593.9\t512.4\t15.9\t16.7\n\u2013 Hardware\t106.8\t115.1\t(7.2)\t(6.3)\n\u2013 Other\t9.9\t11.5\t(13.9)\t(12.8)\n\t710.6\t639.0\t11.2\t12.0",

Transaction-based revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018, increased by $551.3 million, or 29%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was attributable to the growth in GPV processed of $19.3 billion, or 30%, to $84.7 billion from $65.3 billion. We continued to benefit from growth in processed volumes from our existing sellers, in addition to meaningful contributions from new sellers. Additionally, GPV from larger sellers, which we define as all sellers that generate more than $125,000 in annualized GPV, represented 51% of our GPV in the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase from 47% in the fourth quarter of 2017. We continued to see ongoing success with attracting and enabling large seller growth, which we believe will help drive strong GPV growth as we scale. Subscription and services-based revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $339.0 million, or 134%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Growth was driven primarily by Instant Deposit, Caviar, Cash Card, and Square Capital, as well as acquisitions completed in the second quarter. Subscription and services-based revenue grew to 18% of total net revenue in the year ended December 31, 2018, up from 11% in the year ended December 31, 2017. Hardware revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018, increased by $27.1 million, or 65%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase primarily reflects growth in shipments of Square Register following its launch in the fourth quarter of 2017 and, to a lesser extent, the launch of Square Terminal during the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase was also driven by continued growth in sales of our contactless and chip readers, as well as growth in sales of our Square Stand and third-party peripherals driven primarily by new features and product offerings. Additionally, the adoption of ASC 606 resulted in an increase of $5.9 million in hardware revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily related to the earlier revenue recognition of hardware sold through retail distribution channels and hardware installment sales, which were previously recorded upon sell through to the end user customer. Bitcoin revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018, increased by $166.5 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we started offering our Cash App customers the ability to purchase bitcoin from us. Bitcoin revenue comprises the total sale amount we receive from bitcoin sales to customers and is recorded upon transfer of bitcoin to the customer\u2019s account. The sale amount generally includes a small margin added to the price we pay to purchase bitcoin and accordingly, the amount of bitcoin revenue will fluctuate depending on the volatility of market bitcoin prices and customer demand.\nTable:\n\t\tYear Ended December 31,\t\t2017 to 2018\t2016 to 2017\n\t2018\t2017\t2016\t% Change\t% Change\nTransaction-based revenue\t$2,471,451\t$1,920,174\t$1,456,160\t29%\t32%\nStarbucks transaction-based revenue\t\u2014\t\u2014\t78,903\tNM\t(100)%\nSubscription and services-based revenue\t591,706\t252,664\t129,351\t134%\t95%\nHardware revenue\t68,503\t41,415\t44,307\t65%\t(7)%\nBitcoin revenue\t166,517\t\u2014\t\u2014\tNM\tNM\nTotal net revenue\t$3,298,177\t$2,214,253\t$1,708,721\t49%\t30%",

    "context": "Central Overheads declined by $76 million in F19 to $60 million due to a one\u2010off payment from Caltex of $50 million and a reversal of impairment on a property subsequently classified as held for sale of $37 million. Central Overheads are still expected to be approximately $150 million on an annual basis before taking into account any impact from the Endeavour Group transaction. A small increase in inventory to $4,280 million was primarily due to higher closing inventory in New Zealand and BIG W to improve availability. Closing inventory days declined 0.9 days to 37.2 days and average inventory days from continuing operations declined by 0.2 days to 38.8 days. Net investment in inventory of $939 million remained broadly consistent with prior year. Adjusting for the impact of an extra New Zealand Food payment run in the 53rd week of $153 million, net investment in inventory declined by 19%. Other creditors and provisions of $4,308 million decreased $40 million compared to the prior year. Excluding significant items relating to the BIG W network review and cash utilisation of F16 significant items provisions, the decrease in other creditors and provisions was primarily driven by a reduction in accruals associated with store team costs. Fixed assets, investments and loans to related parties of $9,710 million increased by $528 million. Additions of fixed assets of $2,040 million during the year mainly related to store refurbishments, supply chain and IT infrastructure and included $203 million related to property development activity. This was partially offset by depreciation and amortisation, disposals and an impairment of $166 million associated with the BIG W network review. Net assets held for sale of $225 million decreased by $575 million mainly as a result of the sale of the Petrol business to EG Group on 1 April 2019. Intangible assets of $6,526 million increased by $61 million driven by an increase in goodwill and brand names in New Zealand due to the strengthening of the New Zealand dollar, a minor increase in goodwill associated with the acquisition of businesses partially offset by an impairment to the carrying value of Summergate of $21 million. Net tax balances of $227 million increased $66 million due to an increase in deferred tax assets associated with the provisions raised as a result of the BIG W network review. Net debt of $1,599 million increased by $377 million largely due to the timing of New Zealand creditor payments, higher net capital expenditure (excluding the proceeds from the sale of the Petrol business) and an increase in dividends paid during the year. Normalised Return on Funds Employed (ROFE) from continuing operations was 24.2%, 11 bps up on the prior year. Normalised AASB 16 estimated ROFE was 14.1%. Cash flow from operating activities before interest and tax was $3,858 million, an increase of 0.5% on the prior year. Excluding the impact of significant items, higher EBITDA was offset by the impact of the New Zealand payment run in week 53 and a movement in provisions and accruals. The cash flow benefit from an extra week of trading is offset by nine months of EBITDA from the Petrol business compared to a full year in F18. The cash realisation ratio was 74.1%. Excluding the timing of the New Zealand payment run, and charges associated with the BIG W network review and gain on sale of the Petrol business, the cash realisation ratio was 98.4%, impacted by the cash utilisation of provisions and accruals offset by trade working capital improvements. Net interest paid of $166 million declined by 9.8% compared to the prior year due to the early repayment of US Private Placement Notes in the prior year reducing average borrowing costs.\nTable:\nGroup Profit or Loss\tF19\tF18\t\tCHANGE\nfor the 53 weeks ended 30 June 2019\t53 WEEKS\t52 WEEKS\tCHANGE\tNORMALISED\nMARGINS \u2013 continuing operations\t\t\t\t\nGross profit (%)\t29.1\t29.3\t(24) bps\t(23) bps\nCost of doing business (%)\t24.6\t24.9\t(31) bps\t(30) bps\nEBIT (%)\t4.5\t4.5\t7 bps\t7 bps\nEARNINGS PER SHARE AND DIVIDENDS\t\t\t\t\nWeighted average ordinary shares on issue (million)\t1,305.7\t1,300.5\t0.4%\t\nTotal Group basic EPS (cents) before significant items\t142.8\t132.6\t7.7%\t5.8%\nTotal Group basic EPS (cents) after significant items\t206.2\t132.6\t55.5%\t53.7%\nBasic EPS (cents) \u2013 from continuing operations before significant items\t134.2\t123.4\t8.8%\t6.8%\nBasic EPS (cents) \u2013 from continuing operations after significant items\t114.3\t123.4\t(7.4)%\t(9.3)%\nDiluted EPS (cents) \u2013 from continuing operations before significant items\t133.4\t123.1\t8.4%\t6.4%\nDiluted EPS (cents) \u2013 from continuing operations after significant items\t113.6\t123.1\t(7.7)%\t(9.7)%\nInterim dividend per share (cents)\t45\t43\t4.7%\t\nFinal dividend per share (cents) 1\t57\t50\t14.0%\t\nSpecial dividend per share (cents) 1\t\u2013\t10\tn.m.\t\nTotal dividend per share (cents)\t102\t103\t(1.0)%\t",

The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed herein do not have standard meaning and may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies or how we may calculate those measures in other instances from time to time. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Also, our \u201ccore\u201d financial measures should not be construed as an inference by us that our future results will be unaffected by those items that are excluded from our \u201ccore\u201d financial measures.

Among other uses, management uses non-GAAP \u201ccore\u201d financial measures to make operating decisions, assess business performance and as a factor in determining certain employee performance when evaluating incentive compensation. We determine the tax effect of the items excluded from \u201ccore\u201d earnings and \u201ccore\u201d diluted earnings per share based upon evaluation of the statutory tax treatment and the applicable tax rate of the jurisdiction in which the pre-tax items were incurred, and for which realization of the resulting tax benefit, if any, is expected. In certain jurisdictions where we do not expect to realize a tax benefit (due to existing tax incentives or a history of operating losses or other factors resulting in a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets), a reduced or 0% tax rate is applied. We are reporting \u201ccore\u201d operating income, \u201ccore\u201d earnings and \u201ccore\u201d return on invested capital to provide investors with an additional method for assessing operating income and earnings, by presenting what we believe are our \u201ccore\u201d manufacturing operations. A significant portion (based on the respective values) of the items that are excluded for purposes of calculating \u201ccore\u201d operating income and \u201ccore\u201d earnings also impacted certain balance sheet assets, resulting in a portion of an asset being written off without a corresponding recovery of cash we may have previously spent with respect to the asset. In the case of restructuring and related charges, we may make associated cash payments in the future. In addition, although, for purposes of calculating \u201ccore\u201d operating income and \u201ccore\u201d earnings, we exclude stock-based compensation expense (which we anticipate continuing to incur in the future) because it is a non-cash expense, the associated stock issued may result in an increase in our outstanding shares of stock, which may result in the dilution of our stockholders\u2019 ownership interest. We encourage you to consider these matters when evaluating the utility of these non-GAAP financial measures. Included in the tables below are a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures as provided in our Consolidated Financial Statements: Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP Financial Results to Non-GAAP Measures (1) Charges during fiscal years 2019 and 2018 relate to inventory and other assets charges for certain distressed customers in the networking and consumer wearables sectors. Charges during fiscal year 2017 relate to inventory and other assets charges for the disengagement with an energy customer. (2) Charges, net of insurance proceeds of $2.9 million and $24.9 million, for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, relate to business interruption and asset impairment costs associated with damage from Hurricane Maria, which impacted our operations in Cayey, Puerto Rico. (3) Charges related to our strategic collaboration with Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices Companies (\u201cJJMD\u201d). (4) Relates to a restructuring of securities loss on available for sale securities during fiscal year 2019. See Note 16 \u2013 \u201cFair Value Measurements\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

The tax credit carryforwards are included in Deferred tax assets net of unrealized tax benefits that would apply upon the realization of uncertain tax positions. In addition, we had foreign NOL carryforwards of $32 million at December 31, 2019, attributed mainly to losses in France which can be carried forward indefinitely.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (dollars and share amounts in thousands, except per share amounts) Also, as part of the share purchase agreement, the unvested restricted shares of a certain employee of ObserveIT were exchanged into the right to receive $532 of deferred cash consideration. The deferred cash consideration is presented as restricted cash on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet. The deferred cash consideration of $485 was allocated to post-combination expense and was not included in the purchase price. The deferred cash consideration is subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the lapse of the restrictions, and the fair value is expensed as compensation expense over the three-year vesting period. The Discounted Cash Flow Method was used to value the acquired developed technology, in-process research and development asset, customer relationships and order backlog. The Relief from Royalty Method was used to value the acquired trade name. Management applied significant judgment in estimating the fair values of these intangible assets, which involved the use of significant assumptions with respect to forecasted revenue, forecasted operating results and discount rates. The following table summarizes the fair values of tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, intangible assets and goodwill: *Purchased in-process research and development will be accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until the underlying project is completed or abandoned.

The impact of the amount of such changes to previously recorded uncertain tax positions could range from zero to $53.0 million. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits are as follows: During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the statute of limitations on certain unrecognized tax benefits lapsed and certain positions were effectively settled, which resulted in a decrease of $2.5 million, $9.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively, in the liability for uncertain tax benefits. The Company recorded penalties and tax-related interest expense to the tax provision of $10.3 million, $8.0 million and $5.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In addition, due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in certain jurisdictions and certain positions that were effectively settled, the Company reduced its liability for penalties and income tax-related interest expense related to uncertain tax positions during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 by $2.7 million, $16.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the total amount of accrued income tax-related interest and penalties included in the consolidated balance sheets were $26.6 million and $19.1 million, respectively. The Company has filed for prior taxable years, and for its taxable year ended December 31, 2019 will file, numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns, including U.S. federal and state tax returns and foreign tax returns. The Company is subject to examination in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions for certain tax years. As a result of the Company\u2019s ability to carryforward federal, state and foreign NOLs, the applicable tax years generally remain open to examination several years after the applicable loss carryforwards have been used or have expired. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations.

We are exposed to various types of market risks, including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, in the normal course of business. We use financial instruments, including variable rate debt and swaps and foreign exchange spot transactions, to manage risks associated with our interest rate and foreign currency exposures through a controlled program of risk management in accordance with established policies. These policies are reviewed and approved by our board of directors and stockholders\u2019 meeting. Our treasury operations are subject to internal audit on a regular basis. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculatively purposes. Since export sales are primarily conducted in U.S. dollars, we had U.S. dollar-denominated accounts receivable of US$626 million as of December 31, 2019. As of the same date, we also had Japanese Yen-denominated accounts receivable of \u00a514,266 million attributable to our Japanese operations and Renminbi-denominated accounts receivable of RMB\u00a5710 million attributable to our China operations. We had U.S. dollar-, Japanese Yen- and Renminbi-denominated accounts payables of US$128 million, \u00a57,193 million and RMB\u00a5262 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2019. Our primary market risk exposures relate to interest rate movements on borrowings and exchange rate movements on foreign currency denominated accounts receivable, capital expenditures relating to equipment used in manufacturing processes (including lithography, etching and chemical vapor deposition) and purchased primarily from Europe, Japan and the United States.

The SaaS and license revenue renewal rate represents both residential and commercial properties. Our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate is expressed as an annualized percentage. Our service provider partners, who resell our services to our subscribers, have indicated that they typically have three to five-year service contracts with our subscribers. Our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate is calculated across our entire subscriber base on the Alarm.com platform, including subscribers whose contract with their service provider reached the end of its contractual term during the measurement period, as well as subscribers whose contract with their service provider has not reached the end of its contractual term during the measurement period, and is not intended to estimate the rate at which our subscribers renew their contracts with our service provider partners.

At the time of the acquisition, the Company recognized a liability based on the estimated fair value of this contract and service obligation. The Company is amortizing the remaining liability over the estimated remaining term of its associated contract on a weighted basis, based on the projected revenue to be earned under the contract. Amortization of in-process revenue contracts for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $5.9 million (2018 \u2013 $14.5 million, 2017 \u2013 $27.2 million), which is included in revenues on the consolidated statements of loss.

The fair value of $184 of these unvested awards was attributed to pre-combination services and was included in consideration transferred. The fair value of $12,918 was allocated to post-combination services.

    "context": "Note 15. Stock-Based Compensation The following table summarizes the components of non-cash stock-based compensation expense (in thousands): 2015 Equity Incentive Plan We issue stock options pursuant to our 2015 Plan. The 2015 Plan allows for the grant of stock options to employees and for the grant of nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, or RSUs, performance-based stock awards, and other forms of equity compensation to our employees, directors and non-employee directors and consultants. In June 2015, our board of directors adopted and our stockholders approved our 2015 Plan pursuant to which we initially reserved a total of 4,700,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the 2015 Plan, which included shares of our common stock previously reserved for issuance under our Amended and Restated 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, or the 2009 Plan. The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2015 Plan will automatically increase on January 1 each year, for a period of not more than ten years, commencing on January 1, 2016 through January 1, 2024, by 5% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year, or a lesser number of shares as may be determined by the board of directors. As a result of the adoption of the 2015 Plan, no further grants may be made under the 2009 Plan. As of December 31, 2019, 6,527,550 shares remained available for future grant under the 2015 Plan. Stock Options Stock options under the 2015 Plan have been granted at exercise prices based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock options under the 2009 Plan were granted at exercise prices as determined by the board of directors to be the fair market value of our common stock. Our stock options generally vest over a five-year period and each option, if not exercised or forfeited, expires on the tenth anniversary of the grant date. Certain stock options granted under the 2015 Plan and previously granted under the 2009 Plan may be exercised before the options have vested. Unvested shares issued as a result of early exercise are subject to repurchase by us upon termination of employment or services at the original exercise price. The proceeds from the early exercise of stock options are initially recorded as a current liability and are reclassified to common stock and additional paid-in capital as the awards vest and our repurchase right lapses. There were 250 and 957 unvested shares of common stock outstanding subject to our right of repurchase as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We repurchased 27 and 107 of these unvested shares of common stock related to early exercised stock options in connection with employee terminations during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We recorded less than $0.1 million in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets for the proceeds from the early exercise of the unvested stock options as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. We account for stock-based compensation options based on the fair value of the award as of the grant date. We recognize stock-based compensation expense using the accelerated attribution method, net of actual forfeitures, in which compensation cost for each vesting tranche in an award is recognized ratably from the service inception date to the vesting date for that tranche. We value our stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the risk-free interest rate, expected term, expected stock price volatility and dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates for constant maturity U.S. Treasury securities consistent with the expected term of our stock options. The expected term represents the period of time the stock options are expected to be outstanding and is based on the \"simplified method.\" Under the \"simplified method,\" the expected term of an option is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. We use the \"simplified method\" due to the lack of sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to otherwise estimate the expected term of the stock options. Beginning in November 2019, the expected volatility for options granted is based on historical volatilities of our stock over the estimated expected term of the stock options. The expected volatility for options granted prior to November 2019 was based on historical volatilities of our stock and publicly traded stock of comparable companies over the estimated expected term of the stock options. There were 186,500, 219,450 and 252,100 stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We declared and paid dividends in June 2015 in anticipation of our IPO, which we closed on July 1, 2015. Subsequent to the IPO, we do not expect to declare or pay dividends on a recurring basis. As such, we assume that the dividend rate is 0%.\nTable:\n\t\tYear Ended December 31,\t\n\t2019\t2018\t2017\nStock options and assumed options\t$3,783\t$3,511\t$3,913\nRestricted stock units\t16,627\t9,770\t3,366\nRestricted stock awards\t\u2014\t1\t19\nEmployee stock purchase plan\t193\t147\t115\nTotal stock-based compensation expense\t$20,603\t$13,429\t$7,413\nTax benefit from stock-based awards\t$5,154\t$7,581\t$12,719",

    "context": "Note 7: Income Taxes On December 22, 2017, the \u201cTax Cuts & Jobs Act\u201d was signed into law and was effective for the Company starting in the quarter ended December 24, 2017. U.S. tax reform reduced the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, assessed a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. The impact on income taxes due to a change in legislation is required under the authoritative guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 740, Income Taxes, to be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted. In conjunction, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (\u201cSAB\u201d) 118, which allowed for the recording of provisional amounts related to U.S. tax reform and subsequent adjustments related to U.S. tax reform during an up to one-year measurement period that is similar to the measurement period used when accounting for business combinations. The Company recorded what it believed to be reasonable estimates during the SAB 118 measurement period. During the December 2018 quarter, the Company finalized the accounting of the income tax effects of U.S. tax reform. Although the SAB 118 measurement period has ended, there may be some aspects of U.S. tax reform that remain subject to future regulations and/or notices which may further clarify certain provisions of U.S. tax reform. The Company may need to adjust its previously recorded amounts to reflect the recognition and measurement of its tax accounting positions in accordance with ASC 740; such adjustments could be material. The computation of the one-time transition tax on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings was recorded on a provisional basis in the amount of $883.0 million in the fiscal year ended June 24, 2018, as permitted under SAB 118. The Company recorded a subsequent provisional adjustment of $36.6 million, as a result of incorporating new information into the estimate, in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the three months ended September 23, 2018. The Company finalized the computation of the transition tax liability during the December 2018 quarter. The final adjustment resulted in a tax benefit of $51.2 million, which was recorded in the Company\u2019s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the three months ended December 23, 2018. The final balance of total transition tax is $868.4 million. The one-time transition tax is based on the Company\u2019s total post-1986 earnings and profits (\u201cE&P\u201d) that was previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. The Company had previously accrued deferred taxes on a portion of this E&P. The Company has completed the calculation of total post-1986 E&P and related income tax pools for its foreign subsidiaries. The Company elected to pay the one-time transition tax over a period of eight years. Beginning in fiscal year 2019, the Company is subject to the impact of the GILTI provision of U.S. tax reform. The GILTI provision imposes taxes on foreign earnings in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets. The Company has calculated the impact of the GILTI provision on current year earnings and has included the impact in the effective tax rate. The Company made an accounting policy election in the September 2018 quarter to record deferred taxes in relation to the GILTI provision, and recorded a provisional tax benefit of $48.0 million in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the three months ended September 23, 2018, under SAB 118. The Company finalized the computation of the accounting policy election during the December 2018 quarter.

(1) This table generally excludes amounts already recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities, certain purchase obligations as discussed below, long term deferred revenue, and amounts related to income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions, since we cannot predict with reasonable reliability the timing of cash settlements to the respective taxing authorities (see Part II, Item 8, Note 5, \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Notes consist of the Notes issued in December 2012, June 2015 and June 2017. See Part II, Item 8, Note 8, \"Borrowing Arrangements,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.. Term loan consists of the Term Loan Agreement entered into on December 17, 2018 as described above. Operating lease obligations consist primarily of obligations for facilities, net of sublease income, computer equipment and other equipment leases Purchase obligations are contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services and are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on Autodesk and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations relate primarily to enterprise subscription agreements, IT infrastructure costs, and marketing costs Deferred compensation obligations relate to amounts held in a rabbi trust under our non-qualified deferred compensation plan. See Part II, Item 8, Note 7, \u201cDeferred Compensation,\u201d in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this plan. Pension obligations relate to our obligations for pension plans outside of the U.S. See Part II, Item 8, Note 15, \u201cRetirement Benefit Plans,\u201d in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these obligations. Asset retirement obligations represent the estimated costs to bring certain office buildings that we lease back to their original condition after the termination of the lease Purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of supplies and other goods and services are not included in the table above. We are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current procurement or development needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months. In addition, we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. The expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations. We provide indemnifications of varying scopes and certain guarantees, including limited product warranties. Historically, costs related to these warranties and indemnifications have not been significant, but because potential future costs are highly variable, we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations\nTable:\n\tTotal\tFiscal year 2020\tFiscal years 2021-2022\tFiscal years 2023-2024\tThereafter\n\t\t\t(in millions)\t\t\nNotes\t$1,898.3\t$57.3\t$541.7\t$422.3\t$877.0\nTerm loan\t533.8\t18.0\t515.8\t\u2014\t\u2014\nOperating lease obligations\t409.8\t75.4\t115.3\t92.1\t127.0\nPurchase obligations\t82.7\t47.8\t17.0\t11.7\t6.2\nDeferred compensation obligations\t60.3\t5.0\t9.2\t8.8\t37.3\nPension obligations\t25.5\t2.4\t4.6\t4.6\t13.9\nAsset retirement obligations\t10.4\t6.7\t1.1\t1.2\t1.4\nTotal (1)\t$3,020.8\t$212.6\t$1,204.7\t$540.7\t$1,062.8",

Market information Our common stock is currently available for trading in the over-the-counter market and is quoted on the OTCQB under the symbol \u201cPTIX.\u201d There has been very limited market for our common stock and trading volume has been negligible. There is no guarantee that an active trading market will develop in our common stock Trades in our common stock may be subject to Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act, which imposes requirements on broker/dealers who sell securities subject to the rule\nto persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For transactions covered by the rule, broker/dealers must make a special suitability determination for\npurchasers of the securities and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction before the sale. The SEC also has rules that regulate broker/dealer practices in connection with transactions in \u201cpenny stocks.\u201d Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a\nprice of less than $5.00 (other than securities listed on certain national exchanges, provided that the current price and volume information with respect to transactions in that\nsecurity is provided by the applicable exchange or system). The penny stock rules require a broker/dealer, before effecting a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt\nfrom the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the\npenny stock market. The broker/dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker/dealer and its\nsalesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. The bid and offer quotations,\nand the broker/dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing before effecting the transaction, and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer\u2019s confirmation. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for shares of our common stock. As a result of these rules, investors may find it difficult to sell their shares. Our common stock was quoted on the OTC Pink under the symbol \u201cATRN\u201d prior to July 27, 2016 and then under the symbol \u201cPTIX\u201d between July 27, 2016 and\nOctober 16, 2016.

Earnings from our foreign subsidiaries are currently deemed to be indefinitely reinvested. We do not expect such reinvestment to affect our liquidity and capital resources, and we continually evaluate our liquidity needs and ability to meet global cash requirements as a part of our overall capital deployment strategy. Factors which affect our liquidity, capital resources and global capital deployment strategy include anticipated cash flows, the ability to repatriate cash in a tax efficient manner, funding requirements for operations and investment activities, acquisitions and divestitures and capital market conditions. In summary, our cash flows were as follows (in thousands): Net Cash from Operating Activities In 2019, net cash used in operating activities was $11.6 million, which was primarily due to a net loss of $15.4 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $4.3 million. Non-cash charges consisted primarily stock-based compensation expense of $3.1 million and depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets and certain definite- lived intangible assets of $1.2 million. In addition, changes in working capital accounts used cash of $392,000 as a result of a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $1.5 million, partially offset by cash inflow from a decrease in inventory of $483,000, a decrease in accounts receivable of $218,000, a decrease in other assets of $229,000 and an increase in deferred revenue of $158,000. In 2018, net cash used in operating activities was $12.6 million, and resulted primarily from a net loss of $13.8 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $3.6 million. These non-cash charges included write-downs of inventories in the amount of $386,000 to reflect excess quantities, depreciation and amortization of our long-lived assets of $1.3 million and stock-based compensation of $1.9 million. In addition, changes in working capital accounts used cash of $2.4 million as a result of an increase in accounts receivable of $1.3 million, an increase in gross inventory of $662,000, and an increase in other assets of $879,000, partially offset by an increase in accrued liabilities of $235,000 and an increase in trade payables of $223,000. In 2017, net cash used in operating activities was $12.9 million, and resulted primarily from a net loss of $14.1 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $3.1 million. These non-cash charges included write-downs of inventories in the amount of $232,000 to reflect excess quantities, depreciation and amortization of our long-lived assets of $1.4 million and stock-based compensation of $1.4 million. In addition, changes in working capital accounts used cash of $1.9 million as a result of an increase in accounts receivable of $86,000, an increase in gross inventory of $1.8 million, and a decrease of accounts payable of $145,000, partially offset by an increase in accrued liabilities of $72,000. Net Cash from Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities in 2019 was $921,000, which was primarily attributable to the leasehold improvements and computer equipment at the new office premises of $576,000 and capitalization of internal use software of $365,000. Net cash used for investing activities in 2018 was $288,000, primarily for capital expenditures to acquire manufacturing equipment and software, which was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of old equipment. Net cash used for investing activities in 2017 was $642,000, primarily for capital expenditures to acquire manufacturing equipment and software. Net Cash from Financing Activities In 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $7.6 million, primarily attributable to the net proceeds from the issuance of 1.3 million shares of common stock in June 2019. These inflows were partially offset by scheduled repayments of finance lease obligations and tax payments related to net settlement of stock awards. In 2018, net cash provided by financing activities was $22.9 million, resulting from the additional borrowing of $9.0 million under the line of credit, net cash proceeds of $13.9 million from our common stock offering in May 2018 and proceeds of $676,000 from the issuance of common shares to employees under our equity plans. These proceeds were partially offset by scheduled payments of finance lease obligations and tax payments related to net settlement of stock awards. In 2017, net cash provided by financing activities was $15.2 million, resulting from the proceeds of $15.2 million from our stock offering in March 2017 and proceeds of $352,000 from the issuance of common shares to employees under our equity plans, net of taxes paid related to net settlement of equity awards of $198,000. These proceeds were partially offset by payments of $344,000 under the terms of our capital software lease obligations. We require substantial cash to fund our business. However, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with available financial resources from the Revolving Facility will be sufficient to satisfy our operations and capital expenditures over the next twelve months. OurRevolving Facility will expire in September 2021, and we expect to renew this line of credit or find an alternative lender prior to the expiration date. Further, any violations of debt covenants may restrict our access to any additional cash draws from the revolving line of credit, and may require our immediate repayment of the outstanding debt amounts. After the next twelve months, our cash requirements will depend on many factors, including our level of revenue and gross profit, the market acceptance of our existing and new products, the levels at which we maintain inventories and accounts receivable, costs of securing access to adequate manufacturing capacity, new product development efforts, capital expenditures and the level of our operating expenses. In order to satisfy our longer term liquidity requirements, we may be required to raise additional equity or debt financing. There can be no assurance that financing will be available at commercially acceptable terms or at all.\nTable:\n\t\t\tFiscal Year\n\t2019\t2018\t2017\nNet cash (used in) operating activities\t$(11,594)\t$(12,638)\t$(12,938)\nNet cash (used in) investing activities\t(921)\t(288)\t(642)\nNet cash provided by financing activities\t7,600\t22,862\t15,237",

The unrealized losses were primarily due to increases in interest rates relative to rates at the time of purchase.

The$243.1 million of valuation allowance as of September 28, 2018 related primarily to federal and state NOLs, tax credit carryforwards and a partial valuation allowance on tax credits in Canada of$13.6 million whose recovery is not considered more likely than not. The change during the fiscal year endedSeptember 27, 2019 of $9.4 million primarily relates to the reduction of our NOLs due to section 382 limitations, the changes in our temporary differences, and the lower U.S federal tax rate. Our effective tax rates differ from the federal and statutory rate as follows: For fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, the effective tax rates on $423.2 million, $155.2 million and $49.5 million, respectively, of pre-tax loss from continuing operations were 9.3%, 13.8% and (203.8)%, respectively. For fiscal year 2019, the effective tax rate was primarily impacted by a change in our NOL carryforward due to an adjustment in our Section 382 limitation from a prior period acquisition and the immediate recognition of the current and deferred income tax effects totaling $39.8 million from an intra-entity transfer of a license for intellectual property to a higher taxed jurisdiction that received a tax basis step-up. For fiscal year 2018, the effective tax rate was primarily impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"). The effective income tax rates for fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017 were also impacted by a lower income tax rate in many foreign jurisdictions in which our foreign subsidiaries operate, changes in valuation allowance, research and development tax credits, and a fair market value adjustment of warrant liabilities. All earnings of foreign subsidiaries, other than our M/A-COM Technology Solutions International Limited Cayman Islands subsidiary (\"Cayman Islands subsidiary\"), are considered indefinitely reinvested for the periods presented. During fiscal year 2019 we changed our position for our Cayman Islands subsidiary to no longer have its earnings permanently reinvested. Although a foreign subsidiary would typically have to accrue for foreign withholding tax liabilities associated with undistributed earnings, Cayman Islands has no withholding tax under domestic law, therefore, we did not accrue for foreign withholding tax. During fiscal year 2019 we finalized our calculation of the one-time deemed repatriation of gross foreign earnings and profits, totaling $156.8 million, which resulted in approximately $86.7 million in U.S. taxable income for the year ended September 28, 2018 with Grand Cayman and Ireland accounting for$ 59.7 million and $25.6 million, respectively. Due to the fact that we are in a full U.S. valuation allowance, this one-time deemed repatriation had no impact on our tax expense for fiscal year 2018. Our fiscal year 2019 tax provision incorporated changes required by the Tax Act. Some of these changes include a new limitation on the deductible interest expense, inclusion of Global Intangible Low Taxed Income earned by controlled foreign corporations, computation of the new base erosion anti-abuse minimum tax, repealing the performance-based compensation exception to section 162(m) and revising the definition of a covered employee.\nTable:\n\t\tFiscal Years\t\n\t2019\t2018\t2017\nFederal statutory rate\t21.0%\t24.5%\t35.0%\nForeign rate differential\t1.6\t5.1\t31.9\nState taxes net of federal benefit\t0.9\t0.8\t0.2\nWarrant liabilities\t\u2014\t4.4\t(1.8)\nChange in valuation allowance\t(2.4)\t34.0\t(270.0)\nResearch and development credits\t1.4\t9.0\t12.8\nProvision to return adjustments\t0.3\t8.3\t(4.0)\nSection 382 adjustment\t(19.3)\t\u2014\t\u2014\nNondeductible compensation expense\t(0.6)\t1.4\t(4.1)\nGlobal Intangible Low Taxed Income\t(2.9)\t\u2014\t\u2014\nNondeductible legal fees\t\u2014\t0.9\t(3.9)\n2017 tax reform\t\u2014\t(73.7)\t\u2014\nIntra-entity license transfer\t9.4\t\u2014\t\u2014\nOther permanent differences\t(0.1)\t(0.9)\t0.1\nEffective income tax rate\t9.3%\t13.8%\t(203.8)%",

During the year ended December 31, 2018, we had an average of 26.0 ships operating in our owned and bareboat fleet (including ships owned by the Partnership), having 9,030 revenue operating days and an average of 25.5 ships operating under our technical management (including 25.0 of our owned and bareboat ships). Revenues: Revenues increased by 8.1%, or $50.3 million, from $618.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 to $668.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in revenues is mainly attributable to an increase of $63.4 million deriving from the full operation of the GasLog Houston, the GasLog Hong Kong and the GasLog Gladstone which were delivered on January 8, 2018, March 20, 2018 and March 29, 2018, respectively and the deliveries of the GasLog Gladstone on March 15, 2019 and the GasLog Warsaw on July 31, 2019. These deliveries resulted in an increase in revenue operating days. In addition, there was an increase of $11.0 million from our vessels trading in the spot and short-term market including the impact of the unscheduled dry-dockings of the GasLog Savannah, the GasLog Singapore and the GasLog Chelsea and an increase of $2.7 million from the remaining fleet. The above increases were partially offset by a decrease of $26.1 million from the expiration of the initial time charters of the GasLog Shanghai, the GasLog Santiago, the GasLog Sydney, the GasLog Skagen, the GasLog Saratoga and the Methane Jane Elizabeth and a decrease of $0.7 million due to increased off-hire days from the remaining vessels.

Our sales-type lease arrangements contain either a provision whereby the network equipment reverts back to us upon the expiration of the lease or a provision that allows the lessee to purchase the network equipment at a bargain purchase amount at the end of the lease. In addition, our sales-type lease arrangements do not contain any residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.

The increase was attributable to an increase of $57.7 million caused by movements in working capital accounts due primarily to (a) increased cash from related parties of $56.3 million (mainly collection of Cool Pool receivables), (b) an increase of $20.3 million from movements in other payables and accruals, and (c) an increase of $4.6 million from movements in trade and other receivables, partially offset by an increase in cash collateral on swaps of $22.2 million, an increase of $28.2 million in total revenues (revenues and net pool allocation), partially offset by a decrease of $29.9 million in cash paid for interest including the interest paid for finance leases and a net decrease of $22.3 million from the remaining movements. Net Cash Used In Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $250.0 million, from $693.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 to $443.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.

Any adjustments to reduce the cost of inventories to their net realizable value are recognized in earnings in the current period.

The AirBar inventory reserve was $0.8 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In order to protect our manufacturing partners from losses in relation to AirBar production, we agreed to secure the value of the inventory with a bank guarantee. Since the sale of AirBars has been lower than expected, a major part of the inventory at the partner remained unused when the due date of the bank guarantee neared and Neonode therefore agreed that the partner should keep inventory for the production of 20,000 AirBars and the rest be purchased by us.

    "context": "5. INVESTMENTS The Company determines the appropriate designation of investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date. All of the Company\u2019s investments are designated as available-for-sale debt securities. As of September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company\u2019s short-term investments have maturity dates of less than one year from the balance sheet date. The Company\u2019s long-term investments have maturity dates of greater than one year from the balance sheet date. Available-for-sale marketable securities are carried at fair value as determined by quoted market prices for identical or similar assets, with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, and reported as a separate component of stockholders\u2019 equity. Management reviews the fair value of the portfolio at least monthly and evaluates individual securities with fair value below amortized cost at the balance sheet date. For debt securities, in order to determine whether impairment is other than-temporary, management must conclude whether the Company intends to sell the impaired security and whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovering its amortized cost basis. If management intends to sell an impaired debt security or it is more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the security prior to recovering its amortized cost basis, an other-than-temporary impairment is deemed to have occurred. The amount of an other-than-temporary impairment related to a credit loss, or securities that management intends to sell before recovery, is recognized in earnings. The amount of an other-than-temporary impairment on debt securities related to other factors is recorded consistent with changes in the fair value of all other available for-sale securities as a component of stockholders\u2019 equity in other comprehensive income. No other-than-temporary impairment charges were recognized in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017. There were no realized gains or losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities during the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2017. The Company recorded a net realized loss from the sale of available-for-sale securities of $49,000 during the year ended September 30, 2018. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Amortization of premiums, accretion of discounts, interest, dividend income, and realized gains and losses are included in investment income.

The weighted average exercise prices of the outstanding options and outstanding options exercisable at 31 December 2019 for the Share Option Schemes were 304 pence and 309 pence respectively (2018: 302 pence and 309 pence respectively) and for the Save As You Earn Scheme were 77 pence and 278 respectively (2018: 224 pence and nil respectively). A Share Option Schemes Options to subscribe for ordinary shares may be awarded under the intu properties plc Company Share Option Plan and the intu properties plc Non-approved Executive Share Option Scheme. Such options may not be exercised within three years of grant or before the satisfaction or waiver of any applicable performance conditions and will be forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before their options become capable of exercise, except in certain circumstances. The options will lapse if not exercised within 10 years of the date of grant. B Performance Share Plan (PSP) The Company operates a PSP for eligible employees at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee Awards may be made in the form of nil cost options, a conditional share award or prior to April 2019, a joint share ownership award and fixed-value zero-cost option, and eligible employees may be granted any combination of such awards subject to any individual limits. The 2020 PSP awards will vest based on (i) 50 per cent of each award \u2013 relative Total Shareholder Return vs a bespoke real estate sector peer group (this group being expanded from the very small groups used previously) and (ii) 50 per cent of each award \u2013 intu\u2019s Total Property Return vs the MSCI UK Shopping Centre benchmark. This mix of metrics represents a change from the 2019 awards which were based 50 per cent each on relative and absolute TSR targets subject to a Remuneration Committee-operated discretionary assessment of underlying financial performance. It is intended that awards will vest three years following grant (with an additional two year post vesting holding period applying to the net number of shares that vest if the Remuneration Committee considers it appropriate to apply such additional condition). C Bonus Share Scheme (Bonus Scheme) Under the Company\u2019s Bonus Scheme, shares may be awarded on a deferred basis as part of a bonus award (Deferred Share Awards). Deferred Share Awards comprise Restricted Shares and Additional Shares (prior to July 2019). Restricted Shares will vest two or three years after the date of their award and Additional Shares will vest four or five years after the date of award. Vesting is subject, under normal circumstances, to continued employment during the vesting or \u2018restricted\u2019 period. There are no further performance conditions applicable to either Restricted Shares or Additional Shares. Where awarded, the number of Additional Shares would be equal to 50 per cent of the combined total of shares awarded as Restricted Shares and under the Share Incentive Plan (see section D). No Additional Shares were outstanding at 1 January 2014 and no awards of Additional Shares have been made since this time. intu properties D Share Incentive Plan (SIP) The Company operates a SIP for all eligible employees, who may receive up to \u00a33,600 worth of shares (Free Shares) as part of their annual bonus. The SIP is an HMRC tax-advantaged scheme. Any Free Shares awarded under the SIP will be held in trust on behalf of each employee for at least three years following grant, after which time they may be withdrawn, provided the individual employee has remained in employment with the Company. If the Free Shares are held in trust for a further two years, they will qualify for HMRC-approved tax advantages. As part of the SIP arrangements, the Company also offers eligible employees the opportunity to participate in a Partnership share scheme, under which employees can invest up to \u00a31,800 of pre-tax salary (or, if less, 10 per cent of salary) in any tax year, which will be used to purchase ordinary shares in the Company (Partnership Shares) at the end of a 12-month period. The Group will give each employee one ordinary share (a Matching Share) for every two Partnership Shares purchased by the employee. Matching Shares will be forfeited if the employee leaves the Group within three years of the date of award and will qualify for HMRC-approved tax advantages if they are held in the SIP for five years. E Save As You Earn Scheme (SAYE) The Group operates a SAYE under which all eligible UK employees may save up to a maximum of \u00a3500 per month for a period of three or five years and use the proceeds at the end of their saving period to purchase shares in the Company. At the start of the saving period, each SAYE participant will be granted an option to purchase such shares at a price usually determined as the average mid-market closing share price of an ordinary share in the Company over the three consecutive dealing days preceding the SAYE invitation date, discounted by up to 20 per cent. Options may normally be exercised within six months following the end of the savings period. F Joint Share Ownership Plan (JSOP) Eligible employees were invited to participate in the JSOP which formed part of the intu properties plc Unapproved Share Option Scheme (which was replaced by the Non-approved Executive Share Option Scheme upon its expiry in April 2018) and the PSP. Under the JSOP, shares are held jointly by the employee and the employee share ownership plan trustee with any increases in the share price and dividends paid on those shares being allocated between the joint owners in accordance with the terms of the scheme. Conditions under which JSOP interests may be exercised (including applicable performance conditions) are the same as those for the Non-approved Executive Share Option Scheme as outlined in section A.\nTable:\n\tNote\tOutstanding 1 January 2019\tGranted during the year\tExercised during the year\tExpired/forfeited during the year\tOutstanding 31 December 2019\tExercisable 31 December 2019\nShare Option Schemes\tA\t7,938,601\t\u2013\t\u2013\t(801,528)\t7,137,073\t5,687,073\nPerformance Share Plan1\tB\t7,008,260\t3,734,410\t\u2013\t(2,228,278)\t8,514,392\tn/a\nBonus Share Scheme\tC\t1,827,366\t556,840\t(996,503)1\t(16,632)\t1,371,071\tn/a\nShare Incentive Plan2\tD\t243,127\t88,027\t(41,116)1\t(80,736)\t209,302\tn/a\nSave As You Earn Scheme\tE\t219,136\t448,368\t\u2013\t(121,172)\t546,332\t60,443\nJoint Share Ownership Plan\tF\t4,345,305\t\u2013\t\u2013\t(1,382,972)\t2,962,333\t2,962,333",

The majority of the Level 1 assets listed above include the common stock of both U.S. and international companies, mutual funds, master limited partnership units, and real estate investment trusts, all of which are actively traded and priced in the market. Level 2 assets are valued based on other significant observable inputs including quoted prices for similar securities, yield curves, indices, etc. Level 2 assets consist primarily of individual fixed income securities where values are based on quoted prices of similar securities and observable market data. Level 3 assets consist of investments where active market pricing is not readily available and, as such, fair value is estimated using significant unobservable inputs. Certain assets that are measured at fair value using the NAV (net asset value) per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. Such investments are generally considered long-term in nature with varying redemption availability. For certain of these investments, with a fair value of approximately $51.0 million as of May 26, 2019, the asset managers have the ability to impose customary redemption gates which may further restrict or limit the redemption of invested funds therein.

Net investment income: Net investment income from our Insurance segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $95.8 million to $212.9 million from $117.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to the income generated from the assets acquired in the KIC acquisition, higher average invested assets as a result of the reinvestment of premiums and investment income received, and to a lesser extent, rotation into higher-yielding investments.

The decrease was driven by smaller realized gains on bonds and common stocks, higher impairments, and losses on fair value changes on interest only bonds in 2019. The decrease was offset by overall improvement in fair value changes in equity securities and realized gains on mortgage loans in 2019.\nTable:\n\t\tYears Ended December 31,\t\n\t2019\t2018\tIncrease / (Decrease)\nLife, accident and health earned premiums, net\t$116.8\t$94.4\t$22.4\nNet investment income\t212.9\t117.1\t95.8\nNet realized and unrealized gains on investments\t1.9\t5.6\t(3.7)\nNet revenue\t331.6\t217.1\t114.5\nPolicy benefits, changes in reserves, and commissions\t234.4\t197.3\t37.1\nSelling, general and administrative\t35.7\t30.4\t5.3\nDepreciation and amortization\t(23.1)\t(12.4)\t(10.7)\nOther operating expense\t47.3\t\u2014\t47.3\nIncome from operations (1)\t$37.3\t$1.8\t$35.5",

Our subscription terms average one year, but can range from monthly terms to multi-annual terms of up to ten years depending on the product. We generally collect the full amount of subscription fees at the time of sale, while revenue is recognized over the period in which the performance obligations are satisfied, which is generally over the contract term. Revenue is presented net of refunds, and we maintain a reserve to provide for refunds granted to customers Domains revenue primarily consists of revenue from the sale of domain registration subscriptions, domain add-ons and aftermarket domain sales. Domain registrations provide a customer with the exclusive use of a domain during the applicable contract term. After the contract term expires, unless renewed, the customer can no longer access the domain. Hosting and presence revenue primarily consists of revenue from the sale of subscriptions for our website hosting products, website building products, website security products and online visibility products. Business applications revenue primarily consists of revenue from the sale of subscriptions for third-party productivity applications, email accounts, email marketing tools and telephony solutions.

    "context": "15. Income Taxes Nielsen provides for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each balance sheet date, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that future tax benefits associated with a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is provided. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as an adjustment to income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Such tax positions are, based solely on their technical merits, more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities and reflect the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law and significantly changed the way the U.S. taxes corporations. The TCJA reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and created a territorial-style taxing system. The TCJA required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred and also created new taxes on certain types of foreign earnings. As of December 31, 2017, we made a reasonable estimate of the (a) effects on our existing deferred tax balances, and (b) the one-time transition tax. Consequently, our fourth quarter of 2017 and full year 2017 results of operations reflected a non-cash provisional net expense of $104 million. We finalized our accounting for the TCJA in December of 2018 and our results for the fourth quarter of 2018 and full year 2018 results of operations reflect, in accordance with SAB 118, a reduction in tax expense of $252 million as an adjustment to the 2017 provisional expense. This was primarily comprised of a net tax benefit of $57 million relating to finalizing the calculation of the transition tax (including withholding taxes) together with a net tax benefit of $195 million associated with the re-measurement of our deferred taxes. The TCJA imposed a U.S. tax on global intangible low taxed income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) that is earned by certain foreign affiliates owned by a U.S. shareholder and was intended to tax earnings of a foreign corporation that are deemed to be in excess of certain threshold return. As of December 31, 2018, Nielsen made a policy decision and elected to treat taxes on GILTI as a current period expense and have reflected as such within the financial statements as of December 31, 2019 as well. As part of an intercompany restructuring during the year ended December 31, 2018, we transferred certain intellectual property assets between wholly- owned legal entities in non-U.S. tax jurisdictions. As the impact of the transfer was the result of an intra-entity transaction, the resulting gain on the transfer was eliminated for purposes of the consolidated financial statements. The transferring entity recognized a gain on the transfer of assets that was not subject to income tax in its local jurisdiction. In accordance with ASU 2016-16, which the Company adopted in the first quarter of 2018, and as further described in Note 1. \u201cSignificant Accounting Policies\u201d, Nielsen recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $193 million. Throughout 2019, ongoing federal and international audits were effectively settled in certain tax jurisdictions and the impact was recorded accordingly the financial statements.

The services provided, manufacturing processes used, class of customers serviced and order fulfillment processes used are similar and generally interchangeable across the segments.

    "context": "5. Income taxes: On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"TCJA\"). The TCJA amended the Internal Revenue Code and reduced the corporate tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate. The rate reduction was effective on January 1, 2018. The Company's net deferred tax assets represent a decrease in corporate taxes expected to be paid in the future. Under generally accepted accounting principles deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company's net deferred tax asset was determined based on the current enacted federal tax rate of 35% prior to the passage of the Act. As a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and other provisions under the TCJA, the Company made reasonable estimates of the effects of the TCJA and revalued its net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2017 resulting in a reduction in the value of its net deferred tax asset of approximately $9.0 million and recorded a transition tax of $2.3 million related to its foreign operations for a total of $11.3 million, which was recorded as additional noncash income tax expense in the year ended December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had collected all of the necessary data to complete its analysis of the effect of the TCJA on its underlying deferred income taxes and recorded a $0.1 million reduction in the value to its net deferred tax asset. The TCJA subjects a U.S. shareholder to current tax on global intangible low-taxed income earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. FASB Staff Q&A, Topic 740, No. 5, \"Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income\", states that the Company is permitted to make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred income taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as global intangible low-taxed income in future years or provide for the income tax expense related to such income in the year the income tax is incurred.

Under the Loan Agreement, SVB agreed to make advances available up to $10.0 million (the \u201cRevolving Line\u201d). If we borrow from the Revolving Line, such borrowing would carry a floating annual interest rate equal to the greater of (i) the Prime Rate (as defined in the Loan Agreement) then in effect plus 1% or (ii) 6%. Amounts borrowed under the Revolving Line may be repaid and, prior to the Revolving Line Maturity Date (defined below), reborrowed.

Cash equivalents and marketable securities include money market funds, repurchase agreements, term deposits, U.S. and Canadian federal bonds, corporate bonds, and commercial paper, all maturing within the 12 months from December 31, 2019. The following table summarizes our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as at December 31, 2019 and 2018 as well as our operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018: Cash Flows From Operating Activities Our largest source of operating cash is from subscription solutions. These payments are typically paid to us at the beginning of the applicable subscription period, except for our Shopify Plus merchants who typically pay us at the end of their monthly billing cycle. We also generate significant cash flows from our Shopify Payments processing fee arrangements, which are received on a daily basis as transactions are processed. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for third-party payment processing fees, employee-related expenditures, advancing funds to merchants through Shopify Capital, marketing programs, third-party shipping and fulfillment partners, outsourced hosting costs, and leased facilities. For the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by operating activities was $70.6 million. This was primarily as a result of our net loss of $124.8 million, which once adjusted for $158.5 million of stock-based compensation expense, $35.7 million of amortization and depreciation, a $37.9 million increase in deferred income taxes, a $15.9 million increase of our provision for uncollectible merchant cash advances and loans, and an unrealized foreign exchange loss of $3.2 million, contributed $50.4 million of positive cash flows. Additional cash of $162.9 million resulted from the following increases in operating liabilities: $84.6 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to indirect taxes payable, payroll liabilities, and payment processing and interchange fees; $64.6 million in income tax assets and liabilities; $12.3 million in deferred revenue due to the growth in sales of our subscription solutions along with the acquisition of 6RS; and $1.5 million increase in net lease liabilities. These were offset by $142.8 million of cash used resulting from the following increases in operating assets: $74.2 million in merchant cash advances and loans as we continued to grow Shopify Capital; $56.2 million in trade and other receivables; and $12.4 million in other current assets driven primarily by an increase in prepaid expenses, forward contract assets designated for hedge accounting, and deposits. For the year ended December 31, 2018, cash provided by operating activities was $9.3 million. This was primarily as a result of our net loss of $64.6 million, which once adjusted for $95.7 million of stock-based compensation expense, $27.1 million of amortization and depreciation, a $5.9 million increase of our provision for uncollectible merchant cash advances, and an unrealized foreign exchange loss of $1.3 million, contributed $65.4 million of positive cash flows. Additional cash of $38.1 million resulted from the following increases in operating liabilities: $20.6 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities; $9.0 million in deferred revenue; and $8.4 million in lease liabilities. These were offset by $94.2 million of cash used resulting from the following increases in operating assets: $50.7 million in merchant cash advances and loans; $32.6 million in trade and other receivables; and $10.8 million in other current assets. Cash Flows From Investing Activities Cash flows used in investing activities are primarily related to the purchase and sale of marketable securities, business acquisitions, purchases of leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures to support our expanding infrastructure and workforce, purchases of computer equipment, and software development costs eligible for capitalization. Net cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2019 was $ 569.5 million, which was driven by $265.5 million used to make business acquisitions, most of which was for the 6RS acquisition on October 17, 2019, net purchases of $241.6 million in marketable securities, $ 56.8 million used to purchase property and equipment, which primarily consisted of expenditures on leasehold improvements, and $5.6 million used for purchasing and developing software to add functionality to our platform and support our expanding merchant base. Net cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2018 was $810.6 million, reflecting net purchases of $749.7 million in marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities also included $28.0 million used to purchase property and equipment, which primarily consisted of expenditures on leasehold improvements, $19.4 million used to make business acquisitions, and $13.6 million used for purchasing and developing software. Cash Flows From Financing Activities To date, cash flows from financing activities have related to proceeds from private placements, public offerings, and exercises of stock options. Net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2019 was $736.4 million driven mainly by the $688.0 million raised by our September 2019 public offering, and $48.3 million in proceeds from the issuance of Class A subordinate voting shares and Class B multiple voting shares as a result of stock option exercises.

The majority of Verizon\u2019s cash flow is generated from domestic operations and we are not dependent on foreign cash or earnings to meet our funding requirements, nor do we intend to repatriate these undistributed foreign earnings to fund U.S. operations. Furthermore, a portion of these undistributed earnings represents amounts that legally must be kept in reserve in accordance with certain foreign jurisdictional requirements and are unavailable for distribution or repatriation. As a result, we have not provided U.S. deferred taxes on these undistributed earnings because we intend that they will remain indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. and therefore unavailable for use in funding U.S. operations. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred taxes related to these undistributed earnings is not practicable.

We have also reduced the amount of electricity we use, and this coupled with a decrease in BEIS conversion factors has also contributed to our Scope 2 reduction.\nTable:\n\tFY19\tFY18\tFY17\tFY16\nScope 1\t263\t390\t491\t565\nManchester\t213\t281\t361\t357\nLondon\t44\t60\t76\t88\nScope 2\t258\t340\t437\t445\nTotal\t521\t731\t928\t1,010\nRevenue\t355.1\t330.1\t311.5\t281.6\nCarbon intensity\t1.47\t2.21\t2.98\t3.59\nYear-on-year change\t-34%\t-26%\t-17%\t",

Under our market-based PSU program, the number of shares of common stock earned by a recipient is subject to a market condition based on ADTRAN\u2019s relative total shareholder return against all companies in the NASDAQ Telecommunications Index at the end of a three-year performance period. Depending on the relative total shareholder return over the performance period, the recipient may earn from 0% to 150% of the shares underlying the PSUs, with the shares earned distributed upon the vesting. The fair value of the award is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant, adjusted for the expected outcome of the impact of market conditions using a Monte Carlo Simulation valuation method. A portion of the granted PSUs vests and the underlying shares become deliverable upon the death or disability of the recipient or upon a change of control of ADTRAN, as defined by the 2015 Plan. The recipients of the PSUs receive dividend credits based on the shares of common stock underlying the PSUs. The dividend credits vest and are earned in the same manner as the PSUs and are paid in cash upon the issuance of common stock for the PSUs. During the first quarter of 2017, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved a one-time PSU grant of 0.5 million shares that contained performance conditions and would have vested at the end of a three-year period if such performance conditions were met. The fair value of these performance-based PSU awards was equal to the closing price of our stock on the date of grant.

The tankers, named the Overseas Gulf Coast and Overseas Sun Coast, are operating in the international market under the Marshall Islands flag, with both vessels having entered into one-year time charters. In September 2019, the Company sold one of its ATBs for $1,234, net of broker commissions. As a result of the sale, the Company recognized an immaterial gain, which is included in loss/(gain) on disposal of vessels and other property, including impairments, net on the consolidated statements of operations. In May and June 2019, the Company sold two of its ATBs for $1,101 and $1,069, respectively, net of broker commissions. As a result of the sales, the Company recognized an immaterial loss, which is included in loss/(gain) on disposal of vessels and other property, including impairments, net on the consolidated statements of operations. In July 2018 and January 2019, the Company signed binding contracts with Greenbrier Marine (formerly Gunderson Marine LLC) for the construction of two approximately 204,000 BBL, oil and chemical tank barges. The anticipated delivery of the barges to the Company is during the first and second half of 2020, respectively. The Company's remaining commitments under the contracts are $45,849 in 2020. On December 6, 2018, the Company sold one ATB and one barge for $2,367, net of broker commissions. As a result of the sale, the Company recognized a gain of $877, which is included in loss/(gain) on disposal of vessels and other property, including impairments, net on the consolidated statements of operations. In June 2018, one of the Company's ATBs was berthed to the dock when a third-party ship transiting the channel hit the Company's ATB causing structural damage to the Company's ATB and damage to the dock. The cost of repairs has been covered by existing insurance policies. The Company has filed a lawsuit against the third-party ship seeking recovery of its costs of repairs as well as its lost earnings from the ATB being off-hire for 46 repair days. At December 31, 2019, the Company\u2019s owned vessel fleet with a weighted average age of 8.2 years, consisted of six Handysize Product Carriers, two lightering ATBs and two clean ATBs.

Concurrently, the 2011 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2011 Plan\u201d) was terminated and any shares remaining available for new grants under the 2011 Plan share reserve were extinguished. The purpose of the 2019 Plan is to promote the interests of the Company and its stockholders by (i) attracting and retaining key officers, employees and directors of, and consultants to, the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates; (ii) motivating such individuals by means of performance-related incentives to achieve long-range performance goals; (iii) enabling such individuals to participate in the long-term growth and financial success of the Company; (iv) encouraging ownership of stock in the Company by such individuals; and (v) linking their compensation to the long-term interests of the Company and its stockholders. The 2019 Plan is administered by the Compensation and Human Capital Committee (the \u201cCommittee\u201d) of the Board of Directors and allows for the issuance of stock options, stock appreciation rights (\u201cSARs\u201d), RSAs, restricted share units, performance awards, or other stock-based awards. Stock option exercise prices are fixed by the Committee but shall not be less than the fair market value of a common share on the date of the grant of the option, except in the case of substitute awards. Similarly, the grant price of an SAR may not be less than the fair market value of a common share on the date of the grant. The Committee will determine the expiration date of each stock option and SAR, but in no case shall the stock option or SAR be exercisable after the expiration of 10 years from the date of the grant. The 2019 Plan provides for 2,600,000 shares available for grant. As of December 27, 2019, there were 2,222,088 shares available for grant. Stock compensation expense was $4,399, $4,094 and $3,018 for the fiscal years ended December 27, 2019, December 28, 2018 and December 29, 2017, respectively. The related tax benefit for stock-based compensation was $883, $864 and $1,283 for the fiscal years ended December 27, 2019, December 28, 2018 and December 29, 2017, respectively. The following table reflects the activity of RSAs during the fiscal years ended December 27, 2019 and December 28, 2018: The fair value of RSAs vested during the fiscal years ended December 27, 2019, December 28, 2018 and December 29, 2017, was $3,742, $2,936 and $1,703, respectively. These awards are a mix of time-, market- and performance-based grants awarded to key employees and non-employee directors which vest over a range of periods of up to five-years. The market- and performance-based RSAs cliff vest, if at all, after the conclusion of a three-year performance period and vesting is subject to the award recipient\u2019s continued service to the Company as of the vesting date. The number of performance-based RSAs that ultimately vest is based on the Company\u2019s attainment of certain profitability and return on invested capital targets. During fiscal 2019, the Company awarded market-based RSAs that vest based on the Company\u2019s attainment of an average closing trade price of the Company\u2019s common stock of $39.86 per share, based on an average of 20 consecutive trading days. The grant date fair value of these market-based performance awards was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation in order to simulate a range of possible future stock prices.
